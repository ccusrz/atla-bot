"Sokka: Spider rat! They're poisonous! Get behind me.\n\nAang: He's a flying lemur-bat. We keep them as pets.",

"Katara: Your friends were monks?\n\nAang: I know where they are right now. They're at the prayer field.",

"Katara: Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads ... so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.\n\nAang: Nooooooooo ...!",

"Katara: I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ...",

"Katara: What can he do?\n\nKanna: With his mastery of the four elements, he will begin to change hearts. And it is in the heart that all wars are won. Now, go help this boy. He will need you two. And we all need him.",

"Zuko: You are my prisoner ... airbender. I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.\n\nAang: You said ...",

"Aang: They must be playing some trick or something. Monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment. He's the teacher responsible for me. He's kind of like my father.",

"Katara: Aang! You can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need! Don't give up! We can do this together! Aang.",

"Zhao: The banished prince. Let's offer him lunch.",

"Katara: You okay?\n\nAang: I'll be fine.\n\nKatara: You know, my grandma thinks because you're an airbender, that you could be the Avatar.",

"Sokka: Okay! Everybody can help us now!",

"Katara: Don't be afraid!",

"Old man of Kyoshi Town: This was you when you were born an earthbender, two lifetimes ago. You came to our village. Avatar Kyoshi loved games.\n\nAang: I do, too. I mean, I still do.",

"Sokka: Okay. So, what if we found you teachers. Teachers to teach you bending? Which element would you have to learn first?\n\nAang: Water. Water comes after air in the cycle. Air, water, earth, fire.",

"Zuko: We're close, Uncle. They've been moving farther north. We're catching them.\n\nIroh: There are a lot of pretty girls in this town, Zuko. You could fall in love here. We could settle down here, and you could have a blessed life. We don't have to continue this, Zuko.",

"Zuko: We'll catch him soon, Uncle. Then we can think about the pretty girls.",

"Sokka: I guess your talk didn't work.\n\nKatara: He'll be back in a day.",

"Zhao: Do not kill the Avatar! He will just be reborn again!",

"Iroh: Zhao's men were searching the coast, looking for you. They also searched the ship. I told them you went on vacation with a girl. Where were you for the past four days?\n\nZuko: Nowhere. We have to keep moving. The Avatar is traveling again.",

"Iroh: Take rest first. It looks like you went through a great deal. When you wake, we'll have tea together before we start the engines.",

"Pakku: To master water, you must release your emotions, wherever they may lead you. Water teaches us acceptance. Let your emotions flow like water.",

"Yue: When there is some safety for all of us, I will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.\n\nSokka: That would be great. But I warn you ... my grandmother will ask you a lot of questions.",

"Iroh: Now be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck. And remember, your Chi can warm you.\n\nZuko: I know, Uncle.\n\nIroh: Be safe.",

"Aang: Momo, be nice.\n\n [Momo scampers and flies away].",

"Katara: Aang? Aang, can you hear me? I knew you were real. I always knew you'd return.\n\nZuko: Me, too.",

"Iroh: Commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper with. The Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.",

"Iroh: Stop, Zhao. The world will go out of balance. Everyone will be hurt.\n\nZhao: The Fire Nation, is, too powerful ... to worry about children's superstitions, General Iroh.\n\nIroh: Commander Zhao, don't.\n\nZhao: We are now the gods!\n\nIroh: No!",

"Zhao: You are too soft, General Iroh.",

"Iroh: There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.",

"Yue: My people are dying, Sokka. Those who are in charge of others have a responsibility. It is time we show the Fire Nation we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs.\n\nSokka: But Yue ...",

"Iroh: Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.", 

"Aang: It’s easy to do nothing, it’s hard to forgive.",

"Iroh: Sometimes life is like this tunnel. You can’t always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you keep moving, you will come to a better place.",

"Katara: You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won’t have to worry about your destiny anymore; because I’ll make sure your destiny ends, right then and there, permanently.",

"Mai: You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you",

"Sokka: My first girlfriend turned into the moon.",

"Toph: I'm sorry Appa.",

"Iroh: You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone’s support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you.",

"The Cabbage Merchant: My cabbages!!",

"Katara: I know you’re not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won’t stop caring.",

"Katara: You can’t knock me down!",

"Azula: My own mother thought I was a monster… She was right of course, but it still hurt.",

"Appa: [roaring]",

"Azula: Alright hair, it’s time to face your doom!",

"Sokka: It's not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.",

"Katara: Katara: You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water.",

"Sokka: Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah. Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.",

"Katara: You call that left?\n\nSokka: You don't like my steering. Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.",

"Katara: So it's my fault?\n\nSokka: I knew I should have left you home. Leave it to a girl to screw things up.\n\nKatara: You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...",

"Sokka: Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.\n\nKatara: You mean I did that?\n\nSokka: Yup. Congratulations.",

"Zuko: That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!",

"Iroh: Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?",

"Zuko: I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar. Helmsman, head a course for the light!",

"Aang: I need to ask you something.\n\nKatara: What?\n\nAang: Please... come closer.\n\nKatara: What is it?\n\nAang: Will you go penguin sledding with me?\n\nKatara: Uh... sure. I guess.",

"Sokka: What is that thing?\n\nAang: This is Appa, my flying bison.\n\nSokka: Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.",

"Katara: We'd love a ride! Thanks!\n\nSokka: Oh, no. I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.\n\nKatara: Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you freeze to death?",

"Aang: Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip!",

"Aang: Come on, Appa. Yip yip.\n\nSokka: Wow. That was truly amazing.\n\nAang: Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.",

"Katara: Why are you smiling at me like that?\n\nAang: Oh... I was smiling?\n\nSokka: Uuuuugh.",

"Iroh: I'm going to bed now. Yep. A man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.",

"Aang: Uh... why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?",

"Sokka: What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this.\n\nAang: It's not for stabbing. It's for airbending.",

"Zuko:(realization) I understand.",

"Zuko: Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.\n\nAang: Like firebending harmony.",

"Aang: All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is... it's energy, and life.",

"Zuko: That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive... it was my purpose. So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive.",

"Zuko: I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.",

"Aang: With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I would be unstoppable.",

"Sokka: Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.\n\nZuko: It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.\n\nSokka: We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.",

"Sokka: He's kidding, right?",

"Katara: I haven't done this since I was a kid!\n\nAang: You still are a kid!",

"Zuko: The last airbender. (Cut to a profile view of Zuko looking through his telescope) Quite agile for his old age. Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar...",

"Sokka: All right! Ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!\n\nLittle Boy: But, I gotta –\n\nSokka: And no potty breaks!",

"Zuko: I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating. You're just a child!\n\nAang: Well, you're just a teenager.",

"Sokka: Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend.\n\nKatara: He's not my—\n\nSokka: Whatever.",

"Katara: There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe.\n\nKatara: Appa!\n\nSokka: You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?",

"Sokka: What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?",

"Katara: You did it, Sokka!\n\nSokka: He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's—! I mean, big deal, he's flying.",

"Iroh: Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.\n\nZuko: That kid, Uncle, just did this.",

"Aang: Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple here we come!\n\nSokka: Sleep now... temple later...",

"Sokka: Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food.",

"Sokka: Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?\n\nAang: Oh, that was food? I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry.\n\nSokka: You WHAT? Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good",

"Aang: There it is... the Southern Air Temple.\n\nKatara: Aang, it's amazing!\n\nAang: (to Appa) We're home, buddy. We're home.",

"Zhao: The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.\n\nZuko: (Cut to Zuko's upper body.) If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool.",

"Sokka: So where do I get something to eat?",

"Katara: You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple and all you can think about is food?\n\nSokka: I'm just a simple guy with simple needs.",

"Aang: Hahaha! Aang seven, Sokka zero!\n\nSokka: (getting up painfully) Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt.",

"Sokka: Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.\n\nKatara: (walking away from him) I can for Aang's sake.",

"Aang: This whole Avatar thing. Maybe the monks made a mistake\n\nGyatso: The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned 16. But we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is",

"Gyatso: Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?\n\nAang: (smiling) All right.",

"Aang: Katara, whoever's in there might help me figure out this Avatar thing!\n\nSokka: And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious, cured meats!",

"Zhao: So, a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders? You're more pathetic than I thought.\n\nZuko: I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again.",

"Iroh: More tea please?",

"Sokka: Statues?! That's it? Where's the meat?",

"Katara: Aang, snap out of it!\n\nAang: Huh?\n\nKatara: Who is that?\n\nAang: That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.\n\nSokka: You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met",

"Aang: Lemur!\n\nSokka: Dinner...\n\nAang: Don't listen to him! You're going to be my new pet.\n\nSokka: Not if I get him first!",

"Zhao: Once I'm out to sea, my guards will escort you back to your ship and you'll be free to go.\n\nZuko: Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?\n\nZhao: You? Stop me? Impossible.",

"Iroh: Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?\n\nZuko: I will never forget.",

"Aang: Hey! Come back!\n\nAang: Come on out, little lemur. That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.",

"Old Sage: Send word to the Fire Lord immediately. The Avatar has returned!",

"Iroh: Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.\n\nZuko: (standing up) I refuse to let him win.",

"Zhao: That's it? Your father raised a coward.\n\nZuko: Next time you get in my way, I promise I won't hold back.",

"Iroh: So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat. Disgraceful. Even in exile my nephew is more honorable than you. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.",

"Zuko: (quietly) Did you really mean that, Uncle?\n\nIroh: (slyly) Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.",

"Aang: You, me, and Appa. We're all that's left of this place. We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka...",

"Aang: ... say hello to the newest member of our family.\n\nKatara: What are you going to name him?\n\nAang: Momo.",

"Zuko: You taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it.\n\nIroh: Okay, then. We have no idea where he is.\n\nZuko: WHAT?!",

"Sokka: You have no idea where you're going, do you?\n\nAang: Weeelll, I know it's near water...\n\nSokka: (flatly) I guess we're getting close then.",

"Aang: Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick!\n\nKatara: (absentmindedly) That's great, Aang.\n\nAang: You didn't even look.\n\nKatara: That's great!\n\nAang: But I'm not doing it now.",

"Katara:  All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!\n\nSokka: Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these!",

"Aang: Don't worry, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!",

"Sokka: We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?\n\nKatara: He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.",

"Aang:  But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy?",

"Katara: He looks pretty good out there.\n\nSokka: Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.",

"Sokka:We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?\n\nKatara:He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.",

"Aang:(shading his face and looking out over the water)But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I",

"Katara:(Katara turns to see look at something happening off screen.)No, Appa! Don't eat that!\n\nAang:Aww, man...\n\nSokka:(yells)There's something in the water!\n\nKatara:What's wrong?\n\nSokka:Aang's in trouble. (yells) Aang!",

"Katara:(screams)Get out of there!\n\nSokka:Come back here! AANG!\n\nKatara:AANG!\n\nAang:Aaahhh!\n\nKatara:What was that thing?\n\nAang:I don't know.\n\nSokka:(getting up and wiping his hands together)Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road.",

"Momo:(hits the ground)Oof!\n\nAang:(thrown to the ground)Ugh!\n\nKatara:(thrown to the ground)Uhh...\n\nSokka:(thrown to the ground)Oof... Or we could stay a while...",

"Oyagi:You three have some explaining to do.\n\nSuki:And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with the unagi.\n\nSokka: Show yourselves, cowards!\n\nSokka: Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?\n\nSuki: There were no men.",

"Sokka:(in laughing disbelief)Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.\n\nSuki:(threateningly)A bunch of girls, huh? The unagi's gonna eat well tonight.",

"Katara:(quickly)No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.",

"Aang:(apologetically)It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.\n\nOyagi:(pointing at Aang accusingly)How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!",

"Aang:This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!\n\nOyagi:Ha! How could you possibly know her? Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.\n\nAang:I know her because I'm the Avatar.",

"Suki:(shaking her fist at Aang)That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.\n\nAang:That's me!",

"Oyagi:Throw the imposter to the unagi!\n\nKatara:(tersely)Aang... do some airbending...",

"Little Girl:Did you hear the news? The Avatar's on Kyoshi!\n\nFisherman:(drops his basket of fish in shock and surprise.)HUH?\n\nZuko:(standing up and speaking angrily)The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?\n\nIroh:Are you going to finish that?",

"Aang:All right! Dessert for breakfast!\n\nAang:Mmm... Katara you've got to try these!\n\nKatara:Well, maybe just a bite...",

"Aang:(looking off screen)Sokka, what's your problem? EAT!\n\nSokka:Not hungry.\n\nAang:But you're always hungry"

"Aang:What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment.\n\nKatara:Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.",

"Aang:I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?\n\nKatara:Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.",

"Aang:Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.\n\nArtist:(to himself while he paints)Painting the Avatar... that's easy enough...\n\nArtist:Oh... there's another one... I'll make an adjustment here, and...",

"Artist:(to himself while he paints)Painting the Avatar... that's easy enough...\n\nArtist:Oh... there's another one... I'll make an adjustment here, and...\n\nArtist:There'smore... what...\n\n",

"Sokka:(in a bit of an arrogant manner)Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.(He stretches his arms and waist.)I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?(He bends over and grabs his knees with his hands.)\n\n",

"Suki:(sincerely)Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.\n\nSokka:(flippantly)It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.(He rotates his shoulders.)\n\n",

"Suki:(with sarcasm)I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nSokka:True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.\n\n",

"Suki:(leaning towards Sokka and smiling)Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your whole village? Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.\n\nSokka:Oh... well... I mean... I...\n\n",

"Sokka:Let's see if you can handlethis!\n\nSokka:(angrily)That does it!\n\nSuki:(standing over Sokka laughing)Anything else you want to teach us?\n\n",

"Aang:There she is, girls. Me in a past life.\n\nGirls:Ooohhh...\n\nKoko:You were pretty!\n\nAang:Excuse me for a second, ladies.\n\nKatara:(turning around)Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy.\n\n",

"Aang:Actually, I can't right now.\n\nKatara:(irritated)What do you mean you can't?\n\nAang:I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't\n\n",

"Katara:(continuing to pick up vegetables)Watching you show off for a bunch of girls doesnotsound like fun.\n\nAang:Well, neither does carrying your basket.\n\nKatara:It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.\n\n",

"Aang:I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place.\n\nKoko:(stomping her foot in annoyance and putting her hands on her hips)What's taking you so long, Aangy?\n\n",

"Katara:(flatly)Aangy...\n\nAang:(calling back)Just a second, Koko!\n\nKatara:'Simple monk,' huh? I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.\n\n",

"Aang:It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous.\n\nKatara:Jealous? Of what?\n\nAang:Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.\n\n",

"Katara:(ferociously putting vegetables into her basket)That's ridiculous.\n\nAang:It's a little ridiculous, but I understand.\n\n",

"Sokka:(hesitantly)Uh... hey, Suki.\n\nSuki:(mockingly)Hoping for another dance lesson?\n\nSokka:No... I... well, let me explain.\n\n",

"Suki:Spit it out! What do you want?\n\nSokka:(kneeling in humility)I would be honored if you would teach me.\n\nSuki:Even if I'm agirl?\n\nSokka:(quietly)I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong.\n\n",

"Suki:We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.\n\nSokka:Please make an exception. I won't let you down.\n\nSuki:All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.\n\nSokka:(quickly)Of course!\n\n",

"Suki:And I mean ALL of them.\n\nSokka:Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly.\n\n",

"Sokka:(standing proudly)Bravery and honor.\n\nAang:(giggling and racing off)Hey Sokka! Nice dress!\n\n",

"Aang:Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?\n\nKatara:(without looking up from her bowl)Yeah.\n\n",

"Aang:Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be REAL dangerous.\n\nKatara:(still not looking up from her bowl)Good for you.\n\n",

"Aang:(surprised)You're not going to stop me?\n\nKatara:(still not looking up)Nope. Have fun.\n\nAang:(crossing his arms peevishly)I will.\n\nKatara:Great.\n\nAang:I know it's great.\n\nKatara:I'm glad you know.\n\nAang:I'm glad you're glad.\n\nKatara:Good!",

"Suki:You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.\n\nSokka:(slightly losing his balance)I think I'm starting to get it.\n\n",

"Koko:(impatiently)What's taking so long?\n\nAang:I'm sure it will be here any second!(He looks down at the water.)What about this?(Aang suspends and spins the marble between his two hands.)\n\nLittle Girl:Not that again.Boring.\n\n",

"Koko:Where's the unagi? It's getting late.\n\nAang:Where're you going? Don't leave!\n\nKoko:Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.\n\n",

"Aang:(excitedly waving)Katara! You came!\n\nKatara:I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.\n\nAang:Back there you acted like you didn't care.\n\nKatara:I'm sorry.\n\n",

"Aang:Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.\n\nKatara:(affectionately)Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!\n\n",

"Katara:Zuko!\n\nZuko:I want the Avatar alive.\n\nKatara:Wake up, Aang!\n\nAang:(weakly)Katara... don't ride the unagi. Not fun.\n\n",

"Oyagi:Firebenders have landed on our shores! Girls, come quickly!\n\nSokka:Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever!\n\n",

"Zuko:Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever!(to his men)Find him.\n\n",

"Sokka:I guess training's over.\n\n",

"Zuko:Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.\n\n",

"Aang:Hey! Over here!\n\nZuko:Finally!\n\n",

"Aang:(upset)Look what I brought to this place.\n\nKatara:It's not your fault.\n\nAang:Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.\n\n",

"Katara:Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.\n\n",

"Aang:(hanging his head)I'll call Appa.\n\n",

"Suki:There's no time to say goodbye.\n\nSokka:What about, \"I'm sorry\"?\n\nSuki:For what?\n\nSokka:I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a warrior.\n\n",

"Suki:(leaning towards Sokka)I am a warrior.(She kisses him on the cheek.)But I'm a girl, too.(Sokka touches his hand to his cheek, his eyes wide with surprise, and blushes.)Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.\n\n",

"Aang:Appa, yip yip!\n\nZuko:(to his men)Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!\n\n",

"Katara:I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They're going to be okay, Aang.\n\n",

"Aang:(clearly expecting a lecture from Katara)I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.\n\nKatara:Yes, it was.\n\n",

"Aang: The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!\n\nAang: I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.\n\n",

"Katara: Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.\n\nSokka(in amazement): They have buildings here that don't melt!\n\n",

"Aang: Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!\n\nKatara: Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.\n\n",

"Sokka: You need a disguise.\n\nAang: So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?\n\n",

"Aang: Ohh, this is so itchy!(To Appa)How do you live in this stuff?(Appa grunts at him in response.)\n\nSokka: Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.\n\nKatara: Technically, Aang is 112 years old.\n\n",

"Aang(picking up his staff and using a fake, old man voice): Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers! The big city awaits.\n\n",

"Aang: You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.\n\nGate Guard: Rotten cabbages! What kind of slum do you think this is?\n\nCabbage Merchant: Noo! My cabbages!\n\n",

"Aang: Just keep smiling...\n\nGate Guard: State your business!\n\nAang: My business is my business, young man, and none of yours! I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!\n\n",

"Gate Guard: Settle down, old timer. Just tell me who you are.\n\nAang: Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.\n\n",

"Katara(now smiling serenely): Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet you.\n\nGate Guard(pointing to Katara): You seem like a responsible young lady. See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!\n\n",

"Katara: We will.\n\nGate Guard: Wait a minute!(He grabs Sokka by the shoulder just after he passes.)You're a strong young boy. Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag.\n\n",

"Aang: This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes. Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down.(Cut back to the group.)\n\nSokka: Great, so they get their mail on time.\n\n",

"Bumi: Look around you, what do you see?\n\nAang: Umm... the mail system?\n\nBumi(conspiratorially): Instead of seeing what they want you to see, you gotta open your brain to the possibilities.\n\n",

"Aang: A package sending system?\n\nBumi: The world's greatest super slide!\n\nAang: Bumi, you're a mad genius!\n\n",

"Aang: One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor.\n\nKatara: This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second thoughts!\n\n",

"Aang: I'm on it! I'm on it!\n\nOfficer: Men, you'll be going off to combat soon. It's important that you be prepared for anything.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, do something! Use your airbending!\n\nAang: Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!\n\n",

"Aang: Sorry!\n\nCabbage Merchant: My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!\n\nAang(sheepishly): Two cabbages please.\n\n",

"King Bumi: Mmm?\n\nGuard: Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism, traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.\n\n",

"Cabbage Merchant: Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!\n\nGuard: Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?\n\n",

"King Bumi: Throw them... a feast!\n\nAang: Huh?\n\nKing Bumi: Heheh! The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.\n\n",

"Aang: Thanks, but I don't eat meat.\n\nKing Bumi(to Sokka): How about you? I bet you like meat.(He sticks the drumstick in Sokka's mouth.)\n\n",

"Sokka(chewing): Mmm!\n\nKatara(to Aang): Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?\n\n",

"King Bumi: So, tell me young bald one. Where are you from?\n\nAang: I'm from... Kangaroo Island.\n\nKing Bumi: Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hoppin!\n\nSokka: What? It was pretty funny.\n\n",

"King Bumi: There's an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender, the Avatar!(He stands. Aang drops the drumstick, trying to act like he did not just reveal himself.)Now what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?\n\n",

"Aang: Great, you're back! What's for dinner?\n\nSokka: We've got a few options. First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks. Dig in!\n\nKatara: Seriously, what else ya got?\n\n",

"Sokka: What was that!?\n\nAang: It's coming from over there!\n\nSokka: Shouldn't we run away from huge booms – not toward them?\n\n",

"Katara: An earthbender!\n\nAang: Let's go meet him!\n\nSokka: He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.\n\nKatara: Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name?\n\n",

"Aang: Nice to meet you!\n\nKatara: We just wanted to say “hi”.\n\nAang: Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere, maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!\n\n",

"Katara(excited): Which means no nuts for dinner!(Aang and Katara run o.c.)\n\nSokka: Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts!(Momo flies off-screen to join the others, Sokka looks downcast)Yeh, I hate'em too.\n\n",

"Katara: Hey, you're that kid! Why did you run away before?\n\nHaru: Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.\n\nAang: No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending.\n\n",

"Mother(hands still on the window she just closed): They saw you doing what?\n\nHaru: They're crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they're dressed!\n\n",

"Soldier(from o.c.): Open up!\n\nSokka: Fire Nation! Act natural!\n\nMother: What do you want? I've already paid you this week.\n\nSoldier: The tax just doubled. Wouldn't want an accident, would we?\n\n",

"Haru: They're thugs; they steal from us, and everyone here is too much of a coward to do anything about it.\n\nMother: Quiet, Haru. Don't talk like that.\n\nKatara: But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help.\n\n",

"Mother: Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village. He must never use his abilities.\n\n",

"Katara: How can you say that? Haru has a gift. Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.\n\n",

"Mother: You don't understand.\n\nKatara: I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?\n\n",

"Haru: My mom said you can sleep here tonight, but you should leave in the morning.\n\nAang: Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.\n\n",

"Katara: I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.\n\nHaru: That's ok. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store, it reminded me of him.\n\n",

"Haru: My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one, but they fought back anyway.\n\n",

"Katara: He sounds like a great man.\n\nHaru: After the attack, they rounded up my father every other earthbender and took them away. We haven't seen them since.\n\n",

"Katara: So, that's why you hide your earthbending?\n\nHaru: Yeh. The problem is that the only way I can feel close to my father now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.\n\n",

"Katara: See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.\n\n",

"Haru: It's beautiful.\n\nKatara: I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.\n\n",

"Katara:(struggling): It's not working, we have to get help.\n\nHaru: There's no time – pull harder.\n\nKatara: Haru, there's a way you can help him.\n\n",

"Haru: I can't.\n\nKatara: Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.\n\nKatara: Haru, you did it!\n\nKatara: It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.\n\n",

"Aang: You must have really inspired him.\n\nKatara: I guess so.\n\nSokka: Everyone should get some sleep. We're leaving at dawn.\n\n",

"Katara: Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?\n\nSokka: Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.\n\n",

"Katara(with a sly grin on her face): I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.\n\nSokka: Good night.\n\n",

"Katara: The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation. It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending.\n\nSokka: Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?\n\n",

"Katara: Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.\n\nSokka(dropping her hand): Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.\n\n",

"Katara: We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.\n\nAang: ...and why would they do that?\n\n",

"Sokka: I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and – tada! Fake earthbending.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang. Did you get all that?\n\nAang: Sure, I got it.\n\nSokka: Do you remember your cue?\n\nAang: Yeh, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.\n\n",

"Sokka: By “this” do you mean intentionally getting captured by an army of ruthless firebenders?\n\nAang: Exactly! That's fun stuff.\n\n",

"Sokka: Here they come! Get in your places!\n\nSokka(in a slightly exaggerated voice): Get out of my way, pipsqueak!\n\nKatara(also in a slightly exaggerated voice): How dare you call me “pipsqueak” you giant-eared cretin!\n\n",

"Sokka: What did you call me?\n\nKatara: A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things.(She puts her hands up to her ears and fans out her fingers in imitation of huge ears)Do herds of animals use them for shade?\n\n",

"Katara: I'll show you who's boss – earthbending style!\n\nKatara: I said, “earthbending style!”\n\nSoldier(pointing at Momo): That lemur! It's earthbending!\n\nSokka: No, you idiot! It's the girl!\n\n",

"Sokka: Momo, you have some big ears!\n\n",

"Katara(running and hugging him): Haru!\n\nHaru: What are you doing here?\n\nKatara: It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.\n\n",

"Haru: So, you got yourself arrested?\n\nKatara: It was the only way to find you.\n\nHaru(folding his arms across his chest and smiling): You got guts, Katara, I'll give you that.(Taking her shoulder)Come one, there's someone I want you to meet.\n\n",

"Haru: Katara, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is Katara.\n\nKatara(bowing): It's an honor to meet you.\n\nTyro(handing Katara a bowl): Have some dinner, Katara.\n\n",

"Katara(taking the bowl her hungry expression turns to disgust): Eruhh!\n\nTyro: It's not as bad as it looks.\n\nKatara(sitting down and eating a spoonful): Erahh!\n\n",

"Tyro(smiling apologetically): It's still pretty bad though.\n\nPrisoner: Tyro, the prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.\n\n",

"Katara: If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?\n\nTyro(suspiciously): Excuse me?\n\nKatara: You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage?\n\n",

"Tyro: The plan? The plan is to survive - wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.\n\nKatara: How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up.\n\n",

"Tyro: Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth, but people's lives are at stake here. The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.\n\n",

"Sokka: We don't have much time, there are guards everywhere. Get on.\n\nAang: Katara, what's wrong?\n\n",

"Katara(close up, the lighthouse lamp playing directly behind her head): I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up on these people.\n\n",

"Sokka: What do you mean you're not leaving!?\n\nKatara: We can't abandon these people. There has to be a way to help them.\n\nAang: Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?\n\n",

"Sokka: I say you're both crazy!(A searchlight comes close by and they hunker down until it passes.)Last chance, we need to leave – now!\n\n",

"Sokka(shaking his head): I hate when you get like this.(Another search light comes close). Come on, we better hide.\n\n",

"Warden: Tell me exactly what you saw.\n\nCaptain: Well, Sir, it looked like a flying bison.\n\nWarden: What?\n\nGuard: It was a giant flying buffalo, Sir, with an empty saddle.\n\nWarden: Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?\n\n",

"Warden: You! Wake up the Captain. Search the entire rig!\n\nGuard: Sir?\n\nWarden: What!?\n\nGuard: That...was the Captain you just threw overboard, so...\n\nWarden: Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard\n\n",

"Aang: I'm just tossing ideas around.\n\nKatara: I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work. If there was just a way to help them help themselves.\n\n",

"Sokka: For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock... something they can bend.\n\nKatara(touching the rig platform): But this entire place is made of metal.\n\n",

"Aang(looking up and pointing o.c.): No, it's not. Look at the smoke. I bet they're burning coal – In other words, earth.\n\nKatara: It's almost dawn, we're running out of time! Are you sure this is gonna work?\n\n",

"Sokka: It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.\n\n",

"Sokka: There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go – right back here.\n\n",

"Soldier: There's the intruder!\n\nSokka(drawing his boomerang): Stay back, I'm warning you!\n\nTyro: Katara stop! You can't win this fight!\n\n",

"Warden: Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand.\n\nKatara: Here's your chance, earthbenders!(She grabs a lump of coal and raises it high.)Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!\n\n",

"Katara(from o.c. at first): Those clouds look so soft, don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft cottony heap.\n\n",

"Sokka: Maybe you should give it a try.\n\nKatara: You're hilarious.\n\nAang: I'll try it! Yehhhh!\n\n",

"Aang: Turns out clouds are made of water!\n\nKatara: Hey, what is that?\n\nSokka: It's like a scar.\n\n",

"Sokka: Listen, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.\n\nKatara: Aang, are you ok?\n\nSokka: Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for –\n\n",

"Katara: Shh!\n\nSokka(whispering): What? I'm not allowed to be angry?\n\nAang: Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.\n\nAang: Yes it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But, I don't know how to do my job.\n\n",

"Aang: Yeh, a waterbending teacher, but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.\n\n",

"Sokka: The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?\n\nAang: I don't know.\n\n",

"Zuko(yelling): Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!\n\nIroh(happily)>: Over here.\n\nZuko: Uncle? We need to move on, we're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him!\n\n",

"Iroh: You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles.\n\n",

"Zuko(angry): My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!\n\nIroh: You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.\n\n",

"Zuko: Enough! We need to leave now! Get out of the water!\n\nIroh(rising): Very well.\n\nZuko: On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes, but be back at the ship in half an hour or I'm leaving without you.\n\n",

"Katara: Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?\n\nAang: No.\n\nAang: Ow!\n\nAang: Hey, how was that cheering me up?\n\n",

"Old Man: When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible, but those markings... are you the Avatar child?\n\n",

"Old Man: Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope. For the last few days at sunset a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei-Bai, the black and white spirit.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.\n\nAang: Yeh, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the spirit world.(Exasperated)It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!\n\n",

"Katara: So, can you help these people?\n\nAang: I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me.\n\n",

"Katara: I think you can do it, Aang.\n\nSokka: Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.\n\n",

"Iroh: Uh? Who's there?\n\nIroh: A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one.(Lets vole go and leans back in the bath and puts his hands behind his head.)Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.\n\n",

"Soldier: He's a Fire Nation soldier.\n\nCaptain: He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West, the once great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.\n\n",

"Aang: Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm... here to try to help stuff.\n\nSokka: This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.\n\n",

"Old Man: If anyone can save us, he can.\n\nSokka: He still shouldn't have to face this alone.\n\n",

"Aang(shouting): The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai? Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace!\n\nAang: Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then.\n\n",

"Aang: You must be the Hei-Bai spirit.(He bows his head.)My name is...\n\nAang: My name is Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait up!\n\n",

"Sokka: It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him?\n\nOld Man: No, only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei-Bai.\n\nKatara: Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.\n\n",

"Aang: Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?\n\nAang: I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge. Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now!\n\n",

"Sokka: That's it! He needs help!(He exits to his left.)\n\nKatara: Sokka wait!\n\nOld Man: It's not safe!\n\n",

"Sokka: Hei-Bai! Over here!\n\nAang: Sokka, go back!\n\nSokka: We'll fight him together, Aang.\n\nAang: I don't wanna fight him unless I – huh!\n\nKatara: Sokka!\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle! Uncle, where are you?\n\nSoldier: Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?\n\n",

"Zuko: Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!\n\n",

"Sokka: Aang, over here!\n\nSokka: Help!\n\nAang: Hang on, Sokka!\n\nAang: Sokka!(He looks around and the view zooms out a bit.)I failed.\n\n",

"Iroh: Where are you taking me?\n\nCaptain: We're taking you to face justice.\n\nIroh: Right. But where, specifically?\n\n",

"Aang: Katara, Katara I lost him.\n\nOld Man: The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.\n\nAang: What? No, I'm right here! Grrr!!!\n\nAang: I'm in the spirit world!\n\n",

"Aang(smiling): I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem!\n\n",

"Aang: Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either.\n\nKatara: It's ok, Appa. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.\n\n",

"Aang: What am I supposed to do?\n\nAang(shouting): Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?\n\nAang: Sokka?\n\nAang: That's definitely not Sokka!\n\nAang: What? I can't airbend in the spirit world!\n\n",

"Aang: You don't know where Sokka is, do you?\n\nAang: You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me. I need to save my friend and I don't know how. Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?\n\n",

"Aang: I'll be back Katara.(To the dragon)Take me to Roku!\n\n",

"Captain: What's the problem?\n\nIroh: Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose.\n\n",

"Captain: Too loose?\n\nIroh: That's right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.\n\n",

"Aang: I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku.\n\nAang: Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him?\n\n",

"Aang: It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!(Turning to dragon)So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?(The dragon grunts.)But I can't wait that long. I need to save Sokka now.\n\n",

"Katara: You're back! Where's Sokka?\n\n",

"Iroh: Excellent form, Prince Zuko.\n\nZuko: You taught me well.\n\n",

"Captain: Surrender yourselves, it's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.\n\nIroh: Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!\n\n",

"Katara: Sokka!\n\n",

"Sokka: What happened?\n\nKatara: You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you feeling?\n\nSokka(looking pained): Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!\n\n",

"Chief: Thank you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.\n\nSokka: You could give us some supplies and some money.\n\nKatara(angrily elbowing her brother): Sokka!\n\nSokka: What? We need stuff.\n\n",

"Chief(bowing): It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.(He exits.)\n\nKatara: I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your own.\n\n",

"Aang: Actually, I did have a little help. And there's something else.\n\nSokka: What is it?\n\nAang: I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit.\n\n",

"Katara: That's great!\n\nSokka: Creepy, but great.\n\nAang: There's a temple on a crescent shaped island, and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.\n\n",

"Katara: But, the solstice is tomorrow.\n\nAang: Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Aang (groaning and pulling on the reins): Let's go Appa! Come on, boy!\n\nAppa: GRRRRRRR\n\n",

"Aang: Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. (angrily) So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!\n\n",

"Sokka: I think his big butt is trying to tell you something.\n\n",

"Katara: Please don't go, Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.\n\n",

"Aang: But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means. I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today.\n\n",

"Katara: We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.\n\nSokka: At least not without your friends. We got your back.\n\n",

"Chief: It's a long journey to the Crescent Island.(He hands Aang a parcel.)You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it befor/ie sundown. Good luck.\n\nAang: Thank you, for your...\n\nChief (urgently pointing away): Go!\n\n",

"Zuko: Having trouble sleeping?(Zuko pushes the Chief back into the doorway. Camera cuts to a close up of Zuko's face.)Seen the Avatar lately?\n\n",

"Aang: Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster!\n\n",

"Iroh(concerned and frustrated): Sailing into Fire Nation waters... of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish.\n\nZuko: I have no choice, Uncle.\n\n",

"Iroh(angrily): Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?!?!?(With a look of anguish and worry)What if you're caught?\n\n",

"Zuko(turning around from the spy glass): I'm chasing the Avatar. My father will understand why I'm returning home.\n\nIroh: You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, we got trouble.\n\nSokka: Yeah, and its gaining fast!\n\n",

"Iroh(groaning): Really, Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?\n\nZuko: On my mark.........Fire!\n\n",

"Katara: Fire ball!\n\nAang: I'm on it!\n\nKatara(covering her nose with her hand): We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us!\n\n",

"Sokka: Can't you make Appa go any faster?\n\nAang(holding his nose): Yeah, but there's just one little problem.\n\n",

"Zuko: A blockade!\n\nIroh(pulling on his beard thoughtfully): Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.\n\n",

"Aang: If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade. It's the only way.\n\nKatara: There's no time.\n\n",

"Aang: This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous.\n\nKatara: And that's exactly why we're here.\n\n",

"Sokka: Let's run this blockade.\n\nAang: Appa! Yip! Yip!\n\n",

"Zuko: He's not turning around.\n\nIroh: Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do. Do not follow the Avatar.\n\n",

"Zuko(bowing his head): I'm sorry, Uncle.(Turning to his helmsman, he points forward)Run the blockade!\n\nZhao: The Avatar...and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.\n\n",

"Soldier: Commander Zhao, what are your orders?\n\nZhao: Shoot the Bison down.\n\n",

"Aang: Appa! Are you ok?\n\nAppa(affirmatively): Grrrrrr!\n\n",

"Engine Master: Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!\n\nZuko(turning back towards the front of the ship): Do not stop this ship.\n\n",

"Aang: We made it!!!\n\nSokka(in pure disbelief): We got into the Fire Nation......(his shoulders slump)...Great...\n\n",

"Iroh: We're on a collision course!\n\nZuko: We can make it!\n\n",

"Soldier: The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, Sir.\n\nZhao: Wait. Cut the engines. Let them pass.\n\nSoldier: Sir?\n\n",

"Aang: There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to!\n\nAang: You did it buddy. Nice flying.\n\nKatara (to Appa): Oh! You must be tired!\n\n",

"Sokka(thinking that Katara is talking to him) No. (grunting and stretching) I'm good. (jogging in place) Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders.\n\nKatara: I was talking to Appa.\n\nSokka: Well, I was talking to Momo.\n\n",

"Sokka: I don't see any guards.\n\nKatara: The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.\n\nAang: Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry.\n\n",

"Sokka: Wait......I think I heard something.\n\nFire Sage: We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.\n\n",

"Aang: Great! I am the Avatar.\n\nFire Sage: We know.\n\n",

"Aang: I'll hold them off. Run!\n\nFire Sage: If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become. Split up and find him!\n\n",

"Aang: Follow me!\n\nSokka: Do you know where you're going?\n\nAang: Nope! Wrong way!\n\n",

"Shyu: I don't want to fight you. I am a friend.\n\nSokka: Firebenders aren't our friends.\n\nShyu: I know why you're here, Avatar.\n\n",

"Aang(surprised and relaxing his poise): You do?\n\nShyu: Yes. (standing up) You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.\n\n",

"Aang: How?\n\nShyu (gesturing towards the secret passage): This way.\n\nShyu: Time is running out. Quickly!\n\n",

"Zuko: What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?\n\nIroh: Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after...the Avatar.\n\n",

"Zuko: If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.\n\n",

"Shyu: Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.\n\nAang: Did you know Avatar Roku?\n\n",

"Shyu: No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.\n\nAang: Is that how you knew I was coming?\n\n",

"Shyu: A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku, its eyes...began to glow!\n\nKatara: That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!\n\n",

"Shyu: At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.\n\nAang: If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?\n\n",

"Aang: Shyu, what's wrong?\n\nShyu: The sanctuary doors, they're closed.\n\nKatara: Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.\n\nIroh: Hmmmm\n\n",

"Aang: Why won't it open! Aargh!\n\nKatara(grabbing Aang's arm): Aang, stop! There's nothing else we can do.\n\nAang(hanging his head): I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing.\n\n",

"Sokka: I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.\n\nKatara: Sokka! You're a genius!\n\nAang: Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.\n\n",

"Sokka: Come on Aang, let her dream.\n\nKatara: You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work...but it looks like it did.\n\nAang: Did the definition of “genius” change in the last hundred years?\n\n",

"Shyu: Hurry! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary.\n\nFire Sage: How did he get in?\n\nShyu: I don't know. But look at the scorch marks and down there!\n\n",

"Katara: Aang! Now's your chance!\n\nZuko: The Avatar's coming with me!\n\nZuko: Close the doors! Quickly!\n\nKatara: Go!\n\nKatara: He made it!\n\n",

"Aang(standing up): The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?\n\n",

"Zuko: Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!\n\nFire Sage: It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.\n\n",

"Aang: Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!\n\nRoku: It's good to see you, Aang. What took you so long?\n\n",

"Zuko: Why did you help the Avatar?\n\nShyu: Because it was once the Sages' duty. It is still our duty.\n\n",

"Zhao: What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.\n\nFire Sage (bowing): Commander Zhao...\n\n",

"Zhao: And Prince Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work. Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.\n\nZuko: You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.\n\n",

"Zhao: No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out.\n\n",

"Roku: I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.\n\nAang: Is it about that vision? The one with the comet?\n\nRoku: Yes.\n\n",

"Aang: What does it mean?\n\nRoku: One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.\n\n",

"Aang: So the comet made them stronger?\n\nRoku: Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.\n\nAang: But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the war now?\n\n",

"Roku: Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.\n\n",

"Zhao: When those doors open, unleash all your firebending power.\n\n",

"Katara: How's Aang going to make it out of this?\n\nSokka: How're we going to make it out of this?\n\n",

"Aang: What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?\n\nRoku: I know you can do it Aang, for you have done it before. The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways...for now.\n\n",

"Zhao: Ready...\n\nKatara: No! Aang!\n\nZhao: Fire!\n\nShyu: Avatar Roku!\n\nShyu: Avatar Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!\n\nKatara: Not without Aang!\n\n",

"Sokka: We got your back.\n\nAang: Thanks. Where's Shyu?\n\nKatara: I don't know.\n\n",

"Zhao(angrily): No prince. No Avatar. Apparently the only thing I do have is five traitors.\n\nFire Sage: But Commander, only Shyu helped the Avatar.\n\n",

"Sokka: Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway?\n\n",

"Aang: It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.\n\n",

"Sokka: Well, let's see, you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years... I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.\n\n",

"Aang(a frightened expression on his face): I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole! What am I gonna do!?\n\n",

"Katara: Calm down. It's going to be okay. If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.\n\n",

"Aang: You'd do that?\n\nKatara: We'll need to find a good source of water first.\n\n",

"Sokka: Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.\n\nSokka: Nice puddle.\n\n",

"Aang: Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy!\n\nKatara: Remember the reason we're here.\n\n",

"Aang: Oh right, time to practice waterbending.\n\n",

"Sokka: Great. So what am I supposed to do?\n\nAang: You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?\n\n",

"Sokka: So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?\n\nAang(smiling): Mud and bugs!\n\n",

"Sokka(pausing for a second): Okay.\n\n",

"Zuko: Someone's changing our course!\n\nZuko: What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!\n\nIroh: Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.\n\n",

"Zuko: Is it something to do with the Avatar?\n\nIroh: Even more urgent. It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.\n\nZuko: Lotus tile?\n\n",

"Iroh: For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.\n\nZuko(incensed): You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?\n\n",

"Iroh: See, you, like most people, underestimate its value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!\n\n",

"Iroh: I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next.\n\nKatara: This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect, so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away. Just push and pull the water like this...\n\n",

"Katara: The key is getting the wrist movement right.\n\nAang(getting up and imitating Katara): Like this?\n\nKatara: That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually –\n\n",

"Aang: Hey, I'm bending it already!\n\nKatara: Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.(Looking a little unhappy.)It took me two months to learn that move.\n\n",

"Aang: Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.\n\nKatara: Thanks.\n\n",

"Aang: So, what's next.\n\nKatara: This is a more difficult move. I call it \"streaming the water.\"\n\n",

"Katara: It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if...\n\nKatara: Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.\n\n",

"Aang: Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!\n\nKatara: Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave...\n\n",

"Aang: So, like this?\n\nSokka: Aang!\n\nAang: Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?\n\nKatara(crossly): That's enough practicing for today.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeh, I'll say!(Cut to a shot of a bunch of bags floating down the river.)You just practiced our supplies down the river!\n\nAang: Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.\n\n",

"Sokka(sinking back under the water): Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender.\n\n",

"Sokka: We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.\n\n",

"Aang: Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!\n\n",

"Sokka: It doesn't even work.(Momo chitters into Aang's ear as his master stops blowing into it.)See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.\n\n",

"Katara: No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.\n\n",

"Pirate Barker: Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come one by!\n\n",

"Pirate Barker: Oh! You there! I can see by your clothing that you're world traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?\n\n",

"Aang: Sure! What are curios?\n\nPirate Barker(pausing): I'm not entirely sure, but we got'em!\n\n",

"Pirate Captain: I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur. That beast would fetch me a hefty sum, if you'd be interested in bartering.\n\nAang(defensively): Momo's not for sale.\n\n",

"Katara: Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!\n\nAang(to the Pirate Captain): Where did you get a waterbending scroll?\n\n",

"Pirate Captain: Let's just say I got it up north at a most reasonable price. Free!\n\nSokka: Waaait a minute...sea-loving traders...with suspiciously acquired merchandise...and pet reptile birds...You guys are pirates!\n\n",

"Pirate Barker(putting his arm around Sokka's shoulders and smiling): We prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders.\n\nKatara: So, how much for the, uh, \"traded\" scroll?\n\n",

"Pirate Captain: I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom. Unless, of course, you kids have 200 gold pieces on ya right now?\n\n",

"Aang: I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle.(She gives him the 2 copper pieces). Watch and learn.Aang walks over the Pirate Captain.)What say to the price of... one copper piece!\n\n",

"Pirate Captain: Hahaha! The price is 200 gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.\n\nAang: Okay – two copper pieces!\n\nPirate Captain: It's not as amusing the second time, boy.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.\n\nAang(to the Pirate Captain): Aye, we be castin' off now!\n\n",

"Aang: What was that all about, Katara.\n\nSokka: Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.\n\n",

"Katara(hugging herself protectively): I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.\n\nPirate Barker: Hey you, get back here!\n\nAang: Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off.\n\n",

"Katara: I...I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us!\n\nRandom Pirate: Get back here!\n\nPirate Barker: This way! Let's cut'em off!\n\n",

"Cabbage Merchant: My cabbages!(Turning to the camera)This place is worse than Omashu!\n\nRandom Pirate: I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!\n\n",

"Pirate Barker(dual wielding a pair of long knives): Now, who gets to take the steel of my blade first?\n\nAang: No thanks!\n\nAang: Hold on tight!\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!\n\nAang: Just hang on!\n\n",

"Aang: I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.\n\nKatara(smiling): I know, that's why I took – this!\n\n",

"Aang: No way.\n\nKatara: Isn't it great?\n\nSokka(entering from right): No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You stole their waterbending scroll.\n\n",

"Katara(self satisfied): I prefer to think of it as \"high-risk trading.\"\n\nAang(smiling): Haha! Good one, Katara.\n\n",

"Katara: Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.\n\nSokka: It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!\n\n",

"Katara: These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending.\n\nSokka(turning and walking away): Whatever.\n\n",

"Aang: Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it.\n\n",

"Iroh: I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.\n\nZuko(turning to shout at his uncle): It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!\n\n",

"Iroh: Quite the contrary. I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for, is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!\n\n",

"Zuko: You bought a sumki horn?\n\nIroh: For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.\n\nIroh: This place looks promising!\n\n",

"Iroh: Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?\n\nPirate Barker: We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.\n\nZuko(walking over): This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?\n\n",

"Sokka: I'm sorry, but you deserve that.(Screen expands to show Aang on the left. Sokka turns to him.)You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself.\n\n",

"Katara(guiltily): Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip!\n\nKatara(angry): Why can't I get this stupid move!\n\nAang(walking to the river): You'll get it.\n\n",

"Aang: You just gotta shift your weight through the stances...(He gracefully manipulates the whip for a few seconds and then drops it back into the river.)There. See, the key to bending is...\n\n",

"Katara(angry, shaking her fists in front of her): Will you PLEASE shut your air hole! Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes. Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!(She looks over at Sokka, who is not impressed.)What?\n\n",

"Katara(now abashed): Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me. But, you know what, it won't happen again.(She rolls up the scroll and hands it to Aang.)Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.\n\n",

"Aang: It's okay, Katara\n\nSokka: What about Momo? He's the real victim here.\n\nKatara(stroking his ears as he chitters): I'm sorry Momo.\n\n",

"Sokka(clearly milking the situation): And... what about me? There was that time you –\n\nKatara(angrily again): No more apologies!\n\n",

"Pirate Captain: Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?\n\nZuko: We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?\n\nPirate Captain: Uh huh.\n\nZuko: Then they'll be on the water.\n\n",

"Katara(whispering): Shh! Momo, go back to sleep.\n\nKatara(frustrated): Shoot! Come on water, work with me here!\n\n",

"Katara: Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances...(the stream collapses)...ugh!\n\nKatara: No, let go of me!\n\nZuko: I'll save you from the pirates.\n\n",

"Aang:Where's Momo?\n\nAang:Hang on Momo!\n\nAang:All right—you too.\n\nSokka: This is gonna take forever.\n\nAang:That works...\n\n",

"Sokka:These are Fire Nation traps—you can tell from the metalwork. We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.\n\nSokka:Ah-ah...no flying this time.\n\n",

"Katara:What?\n\nAang:Why wouldn't we fly?\n\n",

"Sokka:Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa—he's just too noticeable.\n\nKatara:What! Appa's not too noticeable!\n\n",

"Sokka:He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head—it's kinda hard to miss him!\n\nAang(gently to Appa): Sokka's just jealous ‘cause he doesn't have an arrow.\n\n",

"Sokka(to Aang OC): I know you all want to fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.\n\nKatara:Who made you the boss?\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm not the boss—I'm the leader.\n\nKatara(incredulous): You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior. (tries to speak deeper) So...I'm the leader!\n\nKatara:If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.\n\n",

"Sokka:Are you kidding—he's just a goofy kid!\n\nAang:He's right.\n\nKatara:Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.\n\n",

"Sokka:I-I've kissed a girl—you...just haven't met her.\n\nKatara:Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.\n\n",

"Sokka:No—besides Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts.\n\nKatara:Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.\n\n",

"Aang:Who knows—walking might be fun.\n\nAang: Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?\n\nKatara:I don't know Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts—they seem to know everything.\n\n",

"Sokka:Ha ha. Very funny.\n\nAang:I'm tired of carrying this pack.\n\nKatara:You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!\n\n",

"Sokka:We're cut off!(Meanwhile, the left sleeve of his tunic is on fire.)\n\nAang:Sokka, your shirt!\n\nSokka:If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.\n\n",

"Katara(quietly): What are you doing?\n\nSokka:Bluffing?\n\nCaptain: You? Promise not to hurt us?\n\nAang:Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?\n\n",

"Sokka:Uh...instinct?\n\nKatara:Look!\n\nJet:Down you go.\n\nSoldier: They're in the trees!\n\nSokka:Hey, he was mine!\n\nJet:Gotta be quicker next time.\n\n",

"Sokka(frustrated): Man!\n\nJet(nonchalantly): Hey.\n\nKatara:Hi.\n\nAang(awed): You just took out a whole army almost single-handed!\n\nSokka:Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!\n\n",

"Aang(to the Duke, chuckling): Pipsqueak—that's a funny name.\n\nPipsqueak:You think my name is funny?\n\nAang:It's hilarious.\n\n",

"Katara:Um...thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.\n\nJet:I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning—we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.\n\n",

"Katara:We were relying on instincts.\n\nJet:You'll get yourself killed doing that.\n\nThe Duke:Hey Jet—these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.\n\n",

"Jet:That's a great score.\n\nPipsqueak:And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!\n\n",

"Jet:Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.\n\nPipsqueak:We'll take the stuff back to the hideout.\n\n",

"Aang:You guys have a hideout?\n\nJet:You wanna see it?\n\nKatara:Yes we wanna see it!\n\n",

"Jet:We're here.\n\nSokka:Where...there's nothing here!\n\nJet:Hold this.\n\nSokka:Why...what's this do?\n\n",

"Sokka:Woah!\n\nJet:Aang?\n\nAang:I'll get up on my own.\n\nJet:Grab hold of me Katara.\n\nAang:Nice place you got!\n\n",

"Katara:It's beautiful up here!\n\nJet:It's beautiful...and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?\n\nJet:It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.\n\nKatara:Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?\n\n",

"Katara:That's so brave.\n\nSokka(Sarcastically): Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse.\n\nKatara:Don't pay any attention to my brother.\n\n",

"Jet:No problem. He probably had a rough day.\n\nKatara:So, you all live here?\n\n",

"Jet:That's right. Longshot over there?(cut to Longshot and the Duke walking silently. Longshot's head is slightly bowed)His town got burned down by the fire Nation. And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.\n\n",

"Katara:What about you?\n\nJet:Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.\n\nKatara:Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Jet:I'm so sorry, Katara.\n\nJet:Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.\n\n",

"Katara:Hey Jet, nice speech.\n\nJet:Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today.\n\n",

"Katara:Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training.(She blushes.)\n\nJet:Avatar huh? Very nice.\n\n",

"Aang:Thanks Jet.\n\nJet:So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.\n\nSokka:Unfortunately we have to leave tonight.(He stands and walks away.)\n\n",

"Jet:Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.\n\nSokka:What mission?\n\nJet:What are you doing?\n\nSokka:Shh...it amplifies vibrations.\n\nJet(impressed): Good trick.\n\n",

"Sokka:Nothing yet.(Lowers his voice)Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.\n\nJet(low voice): How many?\n\nSokka:I think there's just one.\n\n",

"Jet:Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.\n\nSokka(Low): Wait! False alarm...he's just an old man.\n\nJet:What are you doing in our woods, you leech.\n\n",

"Old Man:Please sir, I'm just a traveler.\n\nJet:Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!\n\nOld Man(frightened): Oh...please let me go...have mercy...\n\n",

"Jet:Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!\n\nSokka:Jet, he's just an old man!\n\nJet:He's Fire Nation! Search him!\n\n",

"Sokka:But he's not hurting anyone!\n\nJet:Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!\n\nSmellerbee: We've got his stuff, Jet.(He holds up a shoulder satchel the old man was carrying. The old man is back on the ground.)\n\n",

"Sokka:This doesn't feel right.\n\nJet:It's what has to be done—now let's get outta here.\n\nJet:Come on Sokka!\n\n",

"Aang:Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!\n\nAang:Ow! Quit it!\n\nKatara:Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?\n\nSokka:Yeah—he's back. But we're leaving.\n\n",

"Aang:What?\n\nKatara:But I made him this hat.\n\nSokka:Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.\n\nKatara:What? No, he's not.\n\nSokka:He's messed up Katara.\n\n",

"Aang:He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life—a really fun way of life.\n\nSokka:He beat and robbed a harmless old man!\n\nKatara:I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.\n\n",

"Jet:Sokka—you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?\n\nKatara:No, he conveniently left that part out.\n\n",

"Sokka:Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian\n\nJet:He was an assassin, Sokka.\n\nJet:See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife.",

"Katara:I knew there was an explanation\n\nSokka:I didn't see any knife!\n\nJet:That's because he was concealing it.\n\nKatara:See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.\n\n",

"Sokka:There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things.(He leaves.)\n\nJet:Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.\n\n",

"Aang:What can we do?\n\nJet:The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.\n\n",

"Katara:We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.\n\nKatara:You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!\n\n",

"Sokka:Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct—\n\nKatara:Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.\n\n",

"Aang:Sorry Sokka.\n\nJet:Let's go.\n\nJet:Now listen—you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.\n\n",

"Duke:But what about the people in the town—won't they get wiped out too?\n\nJet:Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation.(to Longshot):Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal—got it?\n\n",

"Jet:Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.\n\nSokka:I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.\n\nJet:Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Sokka:There are people living there Jet—mothers and fathers and children.\n\nJet:We can't win without making some sacrifices.\n\nSokka:You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!\n\n",

"Jet:Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.\n\nSokka:I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.\n\n",

"Jet:Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.\n\nKatara:Jet—I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.\n\n",

"Jet:No worries—he already apologized.\n\nAang:Really?(Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.)Sokka apologized?\n\nJet:Yeah—I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.\n\n",

"Katara:Yeah, I did.\n\nJet:I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.\n\n",

"Katara:I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.\n\nJet:All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents. I need you guys to help it along.\n\n",

"Katara:...I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know...\n\nJet:Katara. You can do this.\n\n",

"Aang(back on the ground): What about me?\n\nJet:I know the Avatar can do this.\n\n",

"Jet:Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more geysers and it'll be full.\n\nAang:Look, there's another steam vent.\n\n",

"Jet:Okay. You two keep it up—I'll go check on things at the reservoir.(He turns and walks away.)\n\nKatara:When we're done we'll meet you over there.\n\n",

"Jet:Actually...probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done.\n\nAang:...I bet that's enough—and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.\n\n",

"Katara:Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.\n\nAang:I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.\n\nKatara:Well, we finished early--I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:Come on—move along!\n\nSokka:How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?\n\n",

"Pipsqueak:Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.\n\nSokka:If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:Hey!\n\nSokka:While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work.(He holds up his now-worthless bindings, then turns and walks away.)\n\n",

"Pipsqueak:Hey Smellerbee—you gonna eat your leechee nuts?(A nut strikes him in the head and lands in the pile he's holding.)Ooh.(He picks one up and licks his lips.)\n\nKatara:...What are they doing?\n\n",

"Aang:Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.\n\nKatara:Why would they need blasting jelly?\n\nAang:Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.\n\nKatara:What? No--that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.\n\n",

"Aang:I've gotta stop him.(He runs for the edge.)\n\nKatara(less convinced): Jet wouldn't do that.\n\nJet:Yes I would.\n\nKatara:Jet—why?\n\n",

"Jet:Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother—we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.\n\nKatara:This isn't the answer!\n\n",

"Jet:I want you to understand me Katara. I thought your brother would understand, but—\n\nKatara:Where's Sokka?\n\nJet:Katara.\n\n",

"Aang:I need to get to the dam.\n\nJet:You're not going anywhere without your glider.\n\nAang:I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.\n\nJet:You'll have to if you want your glider back.\n\n",

"Katara:Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me—you're sick and I trusted you!\n\nKatara:What are you doing?\n\nJet:You're too late.\n\n",

"Katara(horrified): No!\n\nAang:Sokka's still out there—he's our only chance.\n\nKatara:Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.\n\n",

"Katara(whisper): No...\n\nAang:Sokka didn't make it in time.\n\nKatara:All those people...(She turns in rage back to Jet.)Jet—you monster!\n\n",

"Jet:This was a victory, Katara. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.\n\nSokka:It will be safe—without you.\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka!\n\nSokka:I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.\n\nJet:What!\n\n",

"Sokka:At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me—the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.\n\n",

"Little Girl(Happily): Missus Pretty!(She hugs her doll.)\n\nJet:Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!\n\n",

"Sokka:Who would be free—everyone would be dead.\n\nJet:You traitor!\n\nSokka:No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.\n\n",

"Jet:Katara. Please—help me.\n\nKatara:Goodbye Jet.\n\nSokka:Yip yip.\n\n",

"Aang:We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?\n\nKatara:Lemme guess—your instincts told you.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey—sometimes they're right.\n\nAang:Um...Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?\n\n",

"Katara: Um...aren't you forgetting the TARP?\n\nSokka: Right...got it.\n\n",

"Katara:(crossly)Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on TOP of the tent. You know, so we don't get RAINED on.\n\nSokka: Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.\n\n",

"Katara: But what if it DOES rain?\n\nSokka:(spreading his arms wide in exasperation)But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing.\n\n",

"Katara:(stomping the ground and gritting her teeth)Ur...arg! You're infuriating!\n\nSokka: Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood because that kindling's looking PRETTY sorry.\n\n",

"Katara:(looking sullen, then exploding in anger)Well if you don't like my firewood...(throws the wood at her brother)have it!\n\n",

"Sokka: Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job(he yanks the rope securing the tent to its to one of its supports. It falls down in a heap)...urg!\n\n",

"Aang: Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the...(Katara and Sokka turn away from each instantly, their arms across their chests, expressions of sullen anger on their faces)Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?\n\n",

"Sokka:(still facing o.c.)Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!\n\n",

"Katara:(whipping around to yell at her brother's back)Oh yeah?(Pointing an accusatory finger)Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the(she bends down quickly, picks up a twig, and throws it at her brother)...Tents!\n\n",

"Aang:(laughs, and spreads his arms wide in a gesture of conciliation)Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?\n\n",

"Katara:(concurrent with Sokka) Sounds good.\n\nSokka:(concurrent with Katara)Whatever.\n\nAang:(smiling in a self satisfied manner)You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar.\n\n",

"Aang: Come on Momo, that's fair.(Motioning to Appa)Appa's got FIVE stomachs.\n\nAang: Here it is, guys, the Great Divide.\n\n",

"Katara: Wow! I could just stare at it forever.\n\nSokka:(unimpressed, the music slurs to a halt in the background)Okay. I've seen enough.\n\n",

"Katara: How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.\n\nSokka: Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.\n\n",

"Scout:(aggressively)Hey! If you're looking for the Canyon Guide, I was here first!\n\nKatara:(clasping her hands in front of her in a gesture of hope)Ooooo...canyon guide. Sounds informative.\n\n",

"Scout: Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender. And the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help. And he's takin' MY tribe across next!\n\nSokka: Calm down, we know you're next.\n\n",

"Scout:(pointing at Sokka o.c.)You wouldn't be calm if the Fire Nation destroyed YOUR home and forced YOU to flee.(He gestures to the vast canyon system in front of them)My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!\n\n",

"Katara: You're a refugee.\n\nScout: Humph. Tell me somethin' I don't know.\n\nKatara: Is that your tribe?\n\nScout: It most certainly is NOT.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their campsite?\n\nScout:(leaning forward to push the Zhang Leader back)Yes! But they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: I didn't know the canyon Guide took reservations.\n\nScout: Heh! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang! So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.\n\n",

"Canyon Guide:(grunting)Sorry about the wait, youngsters.(Gesturing to the majestic canyon below them)Who's ready to cross this here canyon?\n\nKatara: Um...(pointing to her right, o.c.)one of them I think.\n\n",

"Scout: I was here first! My party's on their way!\n\nCanyon Guide: I can't guide people who aren't here.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader:(with mock sadness)Guess you guys'll have to make the trip tomorrow.\n\nScout: Wait! Here they come!\n\n",

"Zhang Leader:(pointing a finger at the Canyon Guide's chest)You're not seriously going to cave into these spoiled Gan Jins! I mean, we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.\n\n",

"Canyon Guide:(holding out the palms of his hands in a gesture of placation)I...uh...well...\n\nScout: We've got old people who are weary from traveling.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: Sick people get priority over old people.\n\nGan Jin Leader: Maybe you Zhang's wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, (cut to the kids as the war of words between the two leaders continues o.c.) maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader:(from o.c.)I could smell your stink a mile away.\n\nKatara:(As Gan Jin Leader speaks)Well Aang, ready to put your peace making skills to the test?\n\n",

"Aang:(looking to the ground in doubt)I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing. These people have been feuding for 100 years.\n\n",

"Katara:(walking forward and raising her voice to be heard by all)Everyone, listen up!(Pointing backward at Aang, a fierce look on her face)This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.\n\n",

"Aang: Uh...you could share the earthbender and travel together?\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation(he points accusingly o.c. at the Zhang)than travel with those stinking thieves.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: We wouldn't travel with you pompous fools anyway!\n\nGan Jin Leader:(pompously)I am not pompous!\n\n",

"Aang:(Angry)Alright! Here's the deal!(Cut to a slowly panning wide shot)We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across. Does that seem fair?\n\nAang: Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own.(Appa grunts.)\n\n",

"Sokka: This feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?\n\nAang: To tell the truth, I'm not sure.(Smiling widely)But when have I ever been?\n\n",

"Katara:(Putting a hand on Aang's shoulder)He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.\n\nSokka:(slumping in despair)His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: No food! This is ridiculous.\n\nCanyon Guide: Aww, you babies can go a day without food. Would you rather be hungry...or dead?\n\n",

"Aang: Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.(He drops down to the ground and addresses Appa)See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!\n\n",

"Aang: Why'd you do that?\n\nCanyon Guide: These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? I gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now.\n\n",

"Sokka: We gotta help him!\n\nSokka: Okay...now you gotta help me!\n\n",

"Aang: What was that?\n\nCanyon Guide: Canyon crawler.(In pain)Oh, ugh! And there's sure to be more.\n\n",

"Katara: Your arms...they're broken.\n\nCanyon Guide: Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words...\n\nAang: ...we're trapped in this canyon.\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: I hope you're happy.(Cut to Aang, Katara and the Guide behind him. He looks displeased at the resumption of the bickering)We're stuck in the canyon with no way out.\n\nZhang Leader: Why don't you thank yourself, food hider!\n\n",

"Aang:(turning to look back o.c. at Katara and the Guide)Any ideas?\n\nCanyon Guide: No bending. We need to get out of this canyon. I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: See? We're going to become part of the food chain because of YOU!\n\nZhang Leader: Sure. Unjustly blame the Zhangs like you ALWAYS do!\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: Gladly!\n\nAang: ENOUGH!(Cut to Aang, angry)I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not going to happen.\n\n",

"Sokka: So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?\n\nZhang Leader: What for? It's the dry season.\n\nSokka:(releasing suppressed exasperation)Exactly!\n\n",

"Zhang Leader:(turning to Sokka, smiling)Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.\n\nSokka: Finally, someone gets it.\n\n",

"Katara: You really think it'll rain?\n\nGan Jin Leader: No, but you can never be too careful, right?\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader:(offering Katara some bread)Would you care for some bread, Katara?\n\nKatara: So it was you guys who had food!\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: Oh come now. You really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should MY people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?\n\n",

"Katara:(hesitating, then taking the bread)Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.(She eats a few bites, then turns back to the Gan Jin Leader)So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: You seem like a smart girl, Katara. I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: Care for some meat?\n\nSokka: Would I!?\n\nZhang Leader: I know what you must be thinking. We're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.\n\nSokka:(munching, barely paying attention)Mm hmm!\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: The Gan Jin think so badly of us they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.\n\n",

"Sokka:(still munching)Mmmm!\n\nZhang Leader: Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years...\n\n",

"Sokka: That's just terrible.(Pointing to her leg of meat)You gonna finish that?\n\n",

"Canyon Guide: It's lonely, isn't it? Being impartial.\n\nAang: I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.\n\n",

"Aang: Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?\n\nKatara:(somewhat harshly)I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.\n\n",

"Aang: What are you talking about?\n\nSokka: Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about? We Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.\n\n",

"Katara:(arms across her chest)Not punished enough if you ask me!\n\nAang: Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help. Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.\n\n",

"Aang: Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat, and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: Maybe the Zhang can climb the walls with their long, disgusting fingernails.\n\nZhang Leader: Oh, sorry! I forgot that to the Gan Jin, unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: Why you dirty thief!\n\nZhang Leader: You pompous fool!\n\nAang: Guys! FOCUS! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, ACTION will!\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: Perhaps the Avatar is right.\n\nGan Jin Leader: Yes, perhaps he is.\n\nZhang Leader: Harsh words will never solve our problems...\n\n",

"Gan Jin Leader: To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!\n\nAang:(nervously)You know, I take it back! Harsh words aren't so bad!\n\n",

"Aang: Is that... food?(In disbelief)Everyone smuggled food down here!?(Turning back to the Zhang)UNBELIEVABLE! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day!? You are all...AWFUL!\n\n",

"Aang: So hungry...(he points at the pie, desperately trying to retain self control)is that...egg custard in that tart?\n\nKatara: Oh no! That's a lot of canyon crawlers!\n\n",

"Sokka:(drawing out his boomerang)We barely survived one!\n\nCanyon Guide: They're coming back for me! They've had a taste, and they're coming back for me!\n\n",

"Katara: Sokka, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive.\n\nSokka:(looking chagrined)Me too. I only took their side because they fed me.\n\n",

"Aang:(shouting)Everybody! Watch me!(He raises a food bag to show everybody)Do what I do!\n\nAang :(shouting)Now, follow me! We're riding out of this hole!\n\n",

"Aang: Everyone! Get off!\n\nZhang Leader:(to Gan Jin Leader)We made it!\n\n",

"Zhang Leader: I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.\n\nGan Jin Leader: And I never knew you Zhang's were so reliable in a pinch.\n\n",

"Aang: Wait a second! Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!\n\nGan Jin Leader: Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.\n\n",

"Aang: There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison. Just a game.\n\nZhang Leader: You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?\n\nAang: Nope, just a regular ball.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader:(to Gan Jin Leader)I suppose it's time we forget the past...\n\nGan Jin Leader:(bowing to Zhang Leader)...and look to the future.\n\n",

"Aang: Good to see ya, boy! Did you miss me?\n\nGan Jin Leader: I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.\n\nAang:(turning to him, drenched in Appa's saliva)Well, you know, I try.\n\n",

"Zhang Leader:(to the crowd)Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe!\n\nCanyon Guide: I'm goin' too! I'm sick of this place!\n\n",

"Sokka: That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.\n\nAang:(smiling)You could call it luck.(Grinning evilly)Or, you could call it... lying!\n\n",

"Sokka: What!?\n\nAang:(sheepishly)I made the whole thing up.\n\n",

"Katara:(in disbelief)You did not!(Then in devilish admiration)That is so wrong.\n\nAang:(looking around)Now where's that custard tart?(Cut to wide shot of them moving to get on Appa)I'm starving!\n\n",

"Katara: We need you, Aang.\n\nAang: I need you too.\n\nAang: Be careful guys! Guys?\n\nAang: Gyatso?\n\nGyatso: Why did you disappear?\n\nAang: I didn't mean to.\n\n",

"Gyatso(from o.c.): We need you, Aang.\n\nMany Voices: We need you, Aang. We need you.\n\nSokka(groggily): Huh? Uh... what's going on? Did we get captured again?\n\n",

"Aang: It's nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.\n\nSokka: Don't have to tell me twice.\n\nKatara: Are you all right, Aang?\n\n",

"Aang: I'm okay.\n\nKatara: You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it?\n\nAang: I think I just need some rest.\n\n",

"Katara(examining empty food bag): Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, cause we're out of food.\n\nSokka(alarmed): Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn't go to the market.\n\n",

"Katara: What happened in your dream?\n\nSokka: Food eats people!\n\nSokka: Also, Momo could talk.(To Momo.)You said some very unkind things.\n\n",

"Iroh: There is a storm coming. A big one.\n\nZuko(lowering the telescope): You're out of your mind, Uncle. The weather's perfect. There is not a cloud in sight.\n\n",

"Iroh: The storm is approaching from the north. I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.\n\nZuko: We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.\n\n",

"Iroh: Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.\n\nZuko: The safety of the crew doesn't matter!\n\nZuko: Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.\n\n",

"Iroh: He doesn't mean that, he's just all worked up.\n\nShopkeeper: Ah, it's good! It's perfect, I'm telling you!\n\n",

"Katara: I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.\n\nShopkeeper: Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?\n\n",

"Aang: I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe.\n\nKatara(putting fruit back): I just realized we're out of money anyway.\n\n",

"Shopkeeper(grabbing basket from Sokka): Awww!\n\nSokka(depressed): Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed to do?\n\n",

"Katara: You could get a job, smart guy.\n\nOld Woman: We shouldn't go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm.\n\n",

"Old Man: Ahh, you're crazy! It's a nice day. No clouds, no wind, no nothing, so quit you're naggin' woman.\n\nAang(to Katara and Sokka): Maybe we should find some shelter?\n\n",

"Old Woman: My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.\n\nOld Man: Well, it's your joints against my brain.\n\n",

"Old Woman: Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, cause I ain't comin!\n\nOld Man: Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get! How do you like that?\n\n",

"Sokka(running up to them): I'll go!\n\nOld Man(pointing at Sokka): You're hired!\n\nSokka(to his friends): What? You said ‘get a job' and he's paying double.\n\n",

"Old Man(looking at Sokka as if he were an alien): Double? Who told ya that nonsense?\n\nLieutenant Jee: Uh! Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.\n\n",

"Iroh(entering from left): Lucky guess.\n\nZuko(crossing to the Lieutenant): Lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect,(pointing at his chest with two fingers)or I will teach it to you.\n\n",

"Iroh: Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.\n\nZuko(to Iroh): I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.\n\n",

"Aang: Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.\n\nSokka: I said I was gonna do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.\n\n",

"Old Woman(from o.c., then from wider shot of boat): The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!\n\n",

"Old Man: That's right! Keep flyin!\n\nKatara: You're a horrible old man!\n\nOld Man: Ehh.\n\n",

"Katara(mounting Appa): Appa, yip! Yip!\n\nSokka: Hey, they left without saying goodbye!\n\n",

"Old Man: You're friends ain't too polite, are they?\n\nSokka: I know! This one time I was...\n\nOld Man(handing Sokka a box): Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, get below deck.\n\n",

"Aang: I'm sorry for running away.\n\nKatara: It's ok. That fisherman was way out of line.\n\nAang: Actually, he wasn't.\n\n",

"Katara: What do you mean?\n\nAang: I don't wanna talk about it.\n\nKatara: It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?\n\nKatara: Talk to me.\n\n",

"Aang: Well, it's kind of a long story.\n\nKatara: I'm gonna try to get a little fire going.\n\n",

"Aang: I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.\n\nAang: I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter...\n\n",

"Aang: First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick.\n\nOlder Boy: Okay! Here goes!(He makes a ball.)\n\nAang: Quick, get on!\n\n",

"Older Boy: Wh, wh, whoaaaa!(He wobbles and is thrown.)Ugh!\n\nAang(dismounting his own scooter): You kinda have to balance on it like it's a top.(He twirls his finger to demonstrate.)\n\n",

"Older Boy: Man, that's hard.\n\nYoung Boy: Where'd ya learn that trick, Aang?\n\n",

"Aang: I made it up.\n\nYoung Boy(doing a goofy dance): Wow!\n\n",

"Monk Gyatso: Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you.\n\nAang: How do you know it's me?\n\n",

"Elder Monk #4: We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?\n\nAang: Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!(He picks up the propeller toy.)\n\n",

"Elder Monk #4: You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.\n\n",

"Aang: I just chose them because they seemed fun.\n\nElder Monk #4: You chose them because they were familiar.\n\n",

"Monk Gyatso: Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned 16, but there are troubling signs, storm clouds are gathering.\n\n",

"Abbot: I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.\n\nMonk Gyatso: We need you, Aang.\n\n",

"Lieutenant Jee: I mean who does Zuko think he is?\n\nIroh(from o.c.): Do you really want to know?\n\nLieutenant Jee: General Iroh! We were just –\n\n",

"Iroh(entering from left, with a hand raised in acceptance): It's ok. May I join you?\n\nLieutenant Jee: Of course, sir!\n\nIroh: Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much...\n\n",

"Zuko: I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass!\n\nIroh: You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.\n\n",

"Zuko: If I'm gonna rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?\n\nIroh: Very well. But you must promise not to speak. These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know.\n\n",

"Zuko(bowing to Iroh): Thank you uncle!\n\nGeneral: The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.\n\n",

"General(coldly): I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait then fresh meat?\n\n",

"Zuko(jumping up): You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?\n\n",

"Iroh: Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out, and there were... dire consequences.\n\n",

"Katara: So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?\n\nAang: Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing...\n\n",

"Aang: Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!\n\nYoung Boy(scooting around Aang): Not only that, we made up a game you can play with the air scooters!\n\n",

"Aang: Great!\n\nAang(dismayed): What's going on?\n\n",

"Older Boy(unhappy, but without malice): Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on.\n\nAang(trying to smile): But I'm still the same – nothing's changed. So, what, I can't play?\n\n",

"Older Boy: That's the only fair way.\n\nAang(dismounting his scooter): Oh, ok.\n\n",

"Young Boy: Sorry, Aang.\n\nOlder Boy: Okay, now who wants to have Jinju on their team?\n\nMonk Gyatso: Very interesting move, young one.\n\n",

"Aang: What do you mean?\n\nAang(pointing at the board): Hey!\n\nElder Monk #4: You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training.\n\n",

"Monk Gyatso: Aang has already trained enough for today.\n\nElder Monk #4: Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.\n\n",

"Monk Gyatso: No, as long as I am his guardian, I will decide when he trains and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.\n\nElder Monk #4(close up, clearly angry): Huh!\n\n",

"Iroh: After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. He said that Prince Zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this...\n\n",

"Aang: Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened.\n\nMonk Gyatso: Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.\n\n",

"Elder Monk #4: Humph! You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.\n\nAbbot: Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.\n\n",

"Katara: That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.\n\nAang: How could they do that to me! They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!\n\n",

"Katara: Whoa! Hot cinders!\n\nAang(his glow fading): I'm sorry I got so mad.\n\n",

"Katara: You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.\n\nAang: Well, that's not exactly what happened...\n\n",

"Aang(from o.c., narrating from the present): I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.\n\n",

"Monk Gyatso: Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?\n\n",

"Aang: I never saw Gyatso again.\n\nAang: Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.\n\n",

"Katara: You ran away.\n\nAang(looking up at Katara): And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.\n\n",

"Katara: You don't know what would've –\n\nAang: The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.\n\nKatara: Aang...\n\n",

"Aang: The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world.\n\n"

"Katara: You're being too hard on yourself. Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.\n\n",

"Aang: You don't know that.\n\nKatara: I know it's meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.\n\n",

"Iroh: When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy...\n\nZuko: Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart! I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: You will fight for your honor.\n\nZuko(stricken, abasing himself on the floor): I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: Rise and fight, Prince Zuko!\n\nZuko: I won't fight you.\n\nFire Lord Ozai: You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.\n\n",

"Iroh: I looked away.\n\nLieutenant Jee(abashed): I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident...\n\n",

"Lieutenant Jee: So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.\n\n",

"Iroh: Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is, the Avatar gives Zuko hope.\n\n",

"Zuko: Where were we hit?\n\nLieutenant Jee: I don't know!\n\nIroh: Look!\n\nZuko: The helmsman!\n\n",

"Katara: Where are they?\n\nAang: Come on, Appa!\n\nAang(pointing to the horizon): The boat! It's there!\n\n",

"Zuko: The Avatar!\n\nLieutenant Jee: What do you want to do, sir?\n\n",

"Zuko(pausing to consider): Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.\n\nIroh: Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.\n\n",

"Sokka: I'm too young to die!\n\nOld Man: I'm not, but I still don't wanna!\n\nAang: Hang on to the rope!\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle, I am sorry.\n\nIroh(smiling, putting a hand on his nephew's shoulder): Your apology is accepted.\n\n",

"Old Woman: Oh, you're alive!(Voice turning sour and pointing to Aang)You owe this boy an apology.\n\nAang: He doesn't have to apologize.\n\n",

"Old Man: Mmm, uh, what if instead of an apology I give him a free fish and we call it even?\n\nAang: Actually, I don't eat meat.\n\n",

"Old Man: Fish ain't meat.\n\nSokka(holding out his hand): Seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right?\n\n",

"Colonel Shinu: – Is nothing but a vanity project! We're fighting a real war here and I need every man I've got, Commander.\n\nZhao: But –\n\n",

"Colonel Shinu: That's final! I don't want to hear another word about it.\n\nZhao: News from Fire Lord Ozai?(Smiles.)It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request is now an order.\n\n",

"Katara: This should bring your fever down.\n\nSokka(feverishly): You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.\n\n",

"Katara: That's nice. I'll tell him.\n\nSokka: Haha! Classic Appa.\n\nAang(walking over): How's Sokka doing?\n\n",

"Katara: Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.\n\nAang: I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map.\n\n",

"Aang: There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.\n\nAang: Not you too!\n\n",

"Katara: Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fine –\n\nAang: That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him – he thinks he's an earthbender!\n\n",

"Sokka(swinging at something that isn't there): Take that, you rock!\n\nAang: A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too.(Getting up and grabbing his staff.)I'm going to find some medicine.\n\n",

"Aang: Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.(Cut back to Appa et al, Aang continues from o.c.)Keep an eye on'em guys.\n\nSokka(deliriously): Haha! You guys are killin' me!\n\n",

"Zuko: What do they want?\n\nIroh(hopefully): Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!\n\n",

"Iroh(making a move on the Pai Sho board): Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him!\n\nZuko(sullenly): I've got nothing to report to Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass.\n\n",

"Herald: Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.\n\nZuko(angrily): Off my ship!\n\n",

"Sokka: Katara... please... water...\n\nKatara: Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.\n\nKatara: Got it?\n\n",

"Aang(speaking very fast): Hello! I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends. They have fevers and they've been coughing and –\n\n",

"Zuko: I don't care what they do.(Looks away out to sea.)\n\nIroh: Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.\n\n",

"Aang(looking frightened and abashed): Taking the cure to my friends!\n\nHerbalist: Ahaha! This isn't a cure, it's Miyuki's dinner.\n\n",

"Herbalist: Plum blossom is her favorite.\n\nAang: What about my friends?\n\nHerbalist: Well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.\n\n",

"Aang: What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?\n\nHerbalist: Why, suck on them of course!\n\n",

"Aang: Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.(Holds up a necklace.)\n\n",

"Katara(from o.c.): So, how do I look?\n\nAang: You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great.\n\n",

"Aang: Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!\n\nCalm Man(to Aang): Well, hello there.(Bears swings at him from o.c., the man dodges.)Nice day, isn't it?\n\n",

"Aang: Make noise, it'll run off!\n\nSokka: No, play dead, he'll lose interest!\n\nCalm Man: Whoa! Close one. Haha!\n\n",

"Katara: Run down hill, then climb a tree!\n\nSokka: No, punch him in the bill!\n\nAang: And then run in zigzags!\n\n",

"Calm Man: No need. It's going to be fine.\n\nAang: Whoa there!\n\n",

"Aang: Aunt who?\n\nCalm Man: No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future.\n\n",

"Katara: Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.\n\nSokka: But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed!\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense.\n\nAang: What do ya know, an umbrella!\n\nKatara: That proves it.(She runs under the umbrella with Aang.)\n\n",

"Sokka(holding the egg above his head to try and deflect the rain): No it doesn't – you can't really tell the future.\n\nKatara: I guess you're not really getting wet then.\n\n",

"Sokka: Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all day.\n\nKatara: Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella.\n\n",

"Sokka: Look, I'm going to predict the future now(making funny motions and in an exaggerated voice)– “It's going to keep drizzling.”(He folds his arms across his chest and assumes an expression of defiance.)See!\n\nAang: Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka(as he gets soaked): Yahhh!\n\nHerald: Aunt Wu is expecting you.\n\nKatara: Really?\n\n",

"Meng(to Aang): Well hello there.\n\nAang(rubbing his nose): Hello.\n\n",

"Meng(as Aang and Katara sit on the pillows): Can I get you some tea, or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?\n\nSokka: I'll try a curd puff.\n\n",

"Meng(giving Sokka the heisman): Just a second.(Bending down to address Aang)So what's your name?\n\nAang: Aang.\n\n",

"Meng: That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?\n\nAang(confused): I... guess...\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh, don't be modest. They're huge!\n\nMeng: Well Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.\n\nAang: Likewise.\n\n",

"Woman in Green: Oh Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love! He's going to give me a rare panda lilly.\n\nMeng(with Aang visible over her right shoulder): That's so romantic.(Looks dreamily over at Aang)I wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower.\n\n",

"Aang(earnestly): Good luck with that!\n\nWoman in Green(amused): Is that the big eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?\n\n",

"Sokka: Not bad. Not bad. Mmmm!(Offers puffs to Aang.)\n\nAang(pushing puffs away): I'm good on puffs. So...what do you think they're talking about back there?\n\n",

"Aunt Wu: I feel great romance for you. The man you're going to marry...\n\nKatara: Tell me more!\n\nAunt Wu: I can see that he is a very powerful bender.\n\n",

"Sokka: Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.\n\nAang: Yeh, when I was in there...\n\nSokka: I don't even wanna know!\n\nAunt Wu: Who's next?\n\n",

"Sokka(standing): Okay, let's get this over with.\n\nAunt Wu(looking unhappily at Sokka): Your future is full of struggle and anguish, most of it self-inflicted.\n\n",

"Sokka: But, you didn't read my palms or anything!\n\nAunt Wu: I don't need to – it's written all over your face.(Cut to Sokka, who looks displeased. To Aang)You then, come with me.\n\n",

"Aunt Wu(confused): A girl? You want to know about love?\n\nAang: Yes!\n\n",

"Sokka: Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax.\n\nKatara: You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.\n\n",

"Sokka(exploding): That woman is crazy! My life will be calm, and happy and joyful!\n\nSokka: Ow!(From o.c.)That doesn't prove anything!\n\n",

"Aang(knowingly): They sure are.\n\nKatara: Why, what did she tell you?\n\nAang(smiling): Some stuff. You'll find out.\n\nKatara(also looking up): What's with the sky?\n\n",

"Sokka(incensed): I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy old woman's superstition.\n\nKatara(putting a hand on Sokka's shoulder): Shhhh!! She's coming!\n\n",

"Aang: Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal.\n\nAang: Never mind.\n\n",

"Aunt Wu: Ahh, you want another reading.\n\nKatara: Yes, please!\n\n",

"Red Shoed Man: Yeh, she said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.\n\nSokka: Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?\n\nRed Shoed Man: Everyday.\n\nSokka: THEN OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO COME TRUE!\n\n",

"Aunt Wu(flabbergasted): You want me to do a reading for that?\n\nSokka: I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!\n\n",

"Aang: So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?\n\nSokka(smugly): Some stuff? You've come to the right place.(Puts his arm around Aang's shoulders and points at his chest in a conspiratorial gesture.)What can I do you for?\n\n",

"Aang: Well, there's this girl...\n\nSokka: I think I know who you mean.\n\nAang: You do? And you're ok with it?\n\nSokka: Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it up.\n\n",

"Aang: Well, how do I do that?\n\nSokka: The number one mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.\n\n",

"Aang(to a sound effect): You can be too nice?\n\nSokka: Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.\n\n",

"Aang(screen pans left to show Meng sidling up to Aang): Well...ok.\n\nMeng: Hey Aang, I was wondering...\n\nAang: See ya later.\n\n",

"Sokka(rubbing his chin in admiration): Wow, that kid is good.\n\n",

"Katara: Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?\n\nAunt Wu: Papaya!(She slams the door shut.)\n\nKatara: Ohhh, I hate papaya.\n\n",

"Aang: Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there.\n\nKatara(walking away): Hey Aang.\n\nAang(shouting after her): That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff.\n\n",

"Katara: Ugh. Papaya please.\n\nAang(trying to sound cool): So...papaya.\n\nKatara: Uh-huh. Would you like some?\n\nAang: You know me.(He picks up a fruit.)I don't really care what I eat.\n\n",

"Aang: Maybe aloof isn't my style.\n\n",


"Sokka(climbing into frame from below): Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.\n\n",

"Aang: But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.\n\n",

"Sokka: What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too.\n\nAang: Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love?(Pointing up.)There, on the rim!\n\nAang: Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong.\n\n",

"Sokka: Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn'em.\n\nAang: There's no time to walk.(He opens up his glider.)Grab on.(He grabs Sokka and they launch into the air.)\n\n",

"Sokka: Aaahhh!\n\nAang: Hi, Katara.\n\nKatara: Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?\n\n",

"Aang: But, she doesn't even charge.\n\nKatara: I know, but still.\n\nSokka: Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.\n\n",

"Katara: Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my min –\n\nKatara: Oh, no!\n\n",

"Sokka: Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong!\n\nGirl in Crowd: Yeh, yeh, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, “Mr. Science and Reason Lover.”\n\n",

"Aang: Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here. You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands.\n\n",

"Sokka(another explosion occurs): Look!(Pointing to the mountain.)Can your fortunetelling explain that?\n\nMan in Crowd: Can your science explain why it rains?\n\nSokka(annoyed): Yes! Yes, it can!\n\n",

"Katara: They just won't listen to reason.(Aang flies back down to them.)\n\nAang: But they will listen to Aunt Wu.\n\nSokka: I know, that's the problem.\n\n",

"Aang: Oh! I didn't see you there.\n\nMeng: You don't like me. Do you?(She is sad, and her enormous hair braids wilt to match her mood.)\n\nAang: Of course I like you.\n\nMeng: But not the way I like you.\n\n",

"Aang: Oh. I guess not.\n\nMeng: It's ok. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way.\n\n",

"Aang(sadly): I know what you mean.\n\nMeng: She's beautiful, by the way.\n\nAang(he blushes): Huh?\n\n",

"Meng: That water tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.(Counting each reason on her fingers.)She's sweet, she's a bender, and her hair seems so manageable.(She tries to mash her braids down and fails at this last reason. She looks crushed.)\n\n",

"Aang: Don't worry. You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you. I know it.(He puts his hands on her shoulders.)\n\n",

"Sokka: Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.\n\nAunt Wu: That's very strange. It shouldn't... Oh my!\n\n",

"Aang: We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.\n\n",

"Sokka: Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.\n\n",

"Aang: If any of you are earthebenders come with me.\n\nTwin in Green #1: I'm an earthbender!\n\nTwin in Green #2: I'm not!\n\n",

"Sokka: Everybody else grab a shovel(explosion sounds)... come on, we've gotta hurry!\n\nSokka: Dig faster! Dig faster!\n\n",

"Aang: Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!\n\nKatara: It's too much! It's gonna overflow!\n\n",

"Sokka: Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender(Katara's expression instantly changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words)that kid is.\n\nKatara: Wait, what did you just say?\n\n",

"Sokka: Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.\n\nKatara: I suppose he is...\n\n",

"Aang(sheepishly looking at the ground): By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.\n\nAunt Wu: So you messed with the clouds did you!\n\n",

"Aunt Wu(begins to laugh): Very clever!\n\nSokka:No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortunetelling.\n\n",

"Calm Man: But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed, and it wasn't. She was right, after all.\n\nSokka(getting right in the Calm Man's face): I hate you.\n\n",

"Katara(taking Sokka by the shoulders): It's ok, Sokka. Everything's gonna be all right.\n\n",

"Aang: Can I ask you something?\n\nAunt Wu: Of course, honey.\n\nAang: You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear.\n\n",

"Meng(waving goodbye): Take care!(Appa turns away, cut to Meng's face, whose smile disappears and is replaced by a frown.)Floozy.\n\n",

"Aang: Hey look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.\n\nSokka (grabbing it): Lemme see that.\n\n",

"Sokka: This is a water tribe weapon.(To Aang, behind him over he left shoulder.)See if you can find anything else.\n\nKatara (entering wider shot): Did someone lose something?\n\n",

"Aang: (looking in a bush): No, we found something.\n\nSokka: It's burned.\n\n",

"Sokka: There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.\n\nSokka: The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill...\n\n",

"Aang: So then what happened?\n\nSokka: I don't know. The trail ends here.\n\nKatara (pointing o.c. to the right): Wait! Look!\n\n",

"Sokka (from o.c.):It's one of our boats!\n\nKatara: Is this... Dad's boat?\n\n",

"Sokka (rubbing the ship's prow and smiling): No, but it's from his fleet. Dad was here.\n\nIroh: Ahh! See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being.\n\n",

"June: Get back! We're after a stowaway.\n\nZuko: There are no stowaways on my ship.\n\nZuko: He's paralyzed.\n\n",

"June (petting her monster as she gets back in the saddle): My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away.\n\nIroh (admiring her): Well, I'm impressed.\n\nIroh (stroking his chin): Very impressed.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Sokka...\n\nSokka: I'm coming with you.\n\nHakoda: You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.\n\n",

"Sokka (his eyes pleading): I'm strong! I'm brave! I can fight! Please, Dad!\n\nSokka (eyes watering): I don't understand.\n\nHakoda: Someday you will. (Sokka drops his sleeping bag and hugs his father.) I'm going to miss you so much.\n\n",

"Sokka: Who's there?\n\nBato: Sokka?\n\nSokka: Bato?\n\n",

"Aang (waking up in the background): Who the what now?\n\nKatara: Bato!\n\n",

"Bato: Sokka! Katara! (Hugging them both.) It is so good to see you two! Oh, you've grown so much.\n\n",

"Aang (bowing): Hi, I'm Aang.\n\nSokka: Where's Dad?\n\nKatara: Is he here?\n\n",

"Aang (bowing): Thank you! It's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything –\n\nSokka (cutting Aang off): What smells so good, Bato? (He sniffs the air.)\n\n",

"Bato: The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.\n\nSokka: Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa? Because he stinks so much! Am I right?\n\n",

"Bato: You have your father's wit.\n\nKatara: Bato! It looks like home!\n\n",

"Sokka: Everything's here, even the pelts!\n\nAang: Yeh, nothing's more comforting than dead animal skins.\n\n",

"Katara: No way! Stewed sea prunes?\n\nBato: Help yourself.\n\n",

"Sokka: Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.\n\nKatara: Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?\n\n",

"Bato: It was your father's idea. He just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging.\n\nAang: Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel –\n\n",

"Sokka (cutting Aang off): So who was it that came up with the great blubber fiasco?\n\nBato (laughing): You knew about that?\n\n",

"Katara: Everyone does.\n\nAang: What's that story?\n\nSokka: It's a long one, Aang, some other time.\n\n",

"Bato: Your dad wore the octopus, but(in a sinister tone)I did the spooky voice.\n\n"

"Zuko: Out of my way! Step aside, filth!\n\nIroh: He means no offense! I'm sure you bathe regularly.\n\nZuko: I need to talk to you.\n\n",

"June: Well, if it isn't my new friends, Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.\n\nZuko: Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back.\n\n",

"Zuko (grabbing her hand as she raises her cup to her lips): Money isn't what I had in mind.\n\nZuko (from o.c.):I need you to find someone.\n\n",

"June: What happened? Your girlfriend run off on you?\n\nZuko: It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with.\n\nJune: Whatever you say.\n\n",

"Zuko: If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for.\n\nJune: Heh! Forget it.\n\nIroh: Plus we'll pay your weight in gold.\n\nJune: Make it your weight and we got a deal.\n\nIroh (laughing): You got it!\n\n",

"Katara: I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad.\n\nBato: It's been far too long, hasn't it? I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does...\n\n",

"Sokka (less exuberantly): It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.\n\n",

"Katara: Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left.\n\nAang (with exaggerated happiness): Yup, but now I'm back. Sure...could go for some delicious sea prunes!\n\n",

"Herbalist (unafraid): Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?\n\nZuko: We're looking for someone.\n\nHerbalist: I hope it's not Miyuki. (Looking down at her cat) Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?\n\n",


"Zuko: Why are we stopping?\n\nJune: Because the girl must of spent a lot of time here.\n\nZuko (grabbing the necklace from June's hand): We have no time for this!\n\n",

"Zuko: Hey, watch it!\n\nJune: Oh look, he likes you.\n\n",

"Aunt Wu: Care to hear your fortune, handsome?\n\nIroh (smiling): At my age there is really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.\n\n",

"Katara: There's no way through!\n\nSokka: We can make it!\n\nBato: Sokka, you've already proven yourself, maybe we should –\n\n",

"Bato: The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.\n\n",

"Bato: For Katara, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.\n\nBato: And for Aang, the mark of the trusted. You are now an honorary member of the water tribe.\n\n",

"Aang: I can't.\n\nKatara: Of course you can!\n\nAang (rubbing off the mark): No, you can't trust me.\n\nKatara: Aang, what are you talking about.\n\n",

"Aang (holding out the crumpled scroll): A messenger gave this to me for Bato. (Katara looks at the scroll and draws in a breath of surprise.) You have to understand, I was afraid you'd –\n\n",

"Sokka (looking at the map, and then Aang in hurt and surprise): This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time!? How could you? (Aang shrivels up.) Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own! I'm going to find Dad.\n\n",

"Katara (looking at Aang, then lowering her eyes): I'm with you, Sokka.\n\n",

"Katara: Good luck.\n\nAang: Okay. You too.\n\nAang: Guess I should be moving on.\n\n",

"Aang: I'm an idiot, Momo.\n\n",

"Katara: That wolf sounds so sad.\n\nSokka: It's probably wounded.\n\n",

"Katara: Sokka?\n\nSokka (after a pause): We need to go back. I want to see Dad, but helping Aang is where we're needed the most.\n\n",

"Katara (smiling): You're right.\n\nBato (putting a hand on each of their shoulders): Your father will understand. And I know he's proud of you.\n\n",

"Superior: A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster and a young man with a scar.\n\nAang: Zuko!\n\n",

"June: So this is your girlfriend.(Zuko hops down and approaches her.)No wonder she left. She's way too pretty for you.\n\nZuko: Where is he? Where's the Avatar?\n\n",

"Sokka (defiantly): We split up! He's long gone.\n\nZuko: How stupid do you think I am?\n\nSokka: Pretty stupid. (Grabbing Katara by the arm) Run!\n\n",

"Zuko: What are we supposed to do now?\n\nJune: It's seeking a different scent – perhaps something that the Avatar held.\n\n",

"Zuko: What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle!\n\nKatara: Aang!\n\nSokka: I'm starting to get some feeling back! (A bunch of tiles fall on them) Ow!\n\n",

"Aang: You've got something I want!\n\nSokka: That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.\n\n",

"Iroh: June! Noooo!\n\nZuko: Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.\n\nIroh: Shh!\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is.\n\nAang: Don't you want to see your father?\n\nSokka: Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more.\n\n",

"Katara: And we need you.\n\nAang: I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you –\n\nKatara: I'll be okay.\n\n",

"Aang: Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like...this!\n\nKatara (grabbing the necklace and putting it on happily): Aang, how did you get that?\n\n",

"Aang (smiling): Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you.\n\nKatara (in mock appreciation): Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko. Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?\n\n",

"Katara: This should give us a good idea of what's around here.\n\nSokka (finishing with the empty bag): See if you can find a menu, I'm starving.\n\n",

"Sokka: A wanted poster. This is bad.\n\nKatara: I think we better keep moving.\n\n",

"Aang: I have to learn firebending at some point, and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.\n\nKatara (looking at the ground, unsure): I guess we could check it out.\n\n",

"Sokka: What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?\n\nKatara: We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.\n\n",

"Sokka (to no one): Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble.\n\nAang: You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.\n\n",

"Aang: Ready disguises!\n\nSokka (sarcastically): It's like you're a whole different person.\n\n",

"Aang: Let's go.\n\nKatara: I think we need some new disguises.\n\n",

"Sokka (skeptical and annoyed): Where are we gonna get masks like that?\n\nMask Merchant: Get your genu-ine Fire Festival masks here!\n\n",

"Sokka (as Aang and Katara rush over): That was surprisingly easy.\n\nAang (pointing ahead, o.c.): Hey, there's some food.\n\n",

"Sokka (running ahead): Finally! (To food merchant): What do you have?\n\nFood Merchant: Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.\n\n",

"Sokka: I'll take'em!\n\nSokka: Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!\n\n",

"Katara (Crossing her arms): \"Flaming fire flakes\" hot? What do you know.\n\nAang (looking o.c. to his right): Hey, look at this.\n\n",

"Puppet Fire Lord: Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!\n\nKatara: Aang, hold on! Where are we going?\n\n",

"Aang: I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.\n\nSokka: Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.\n\n",

"Aang: I gotta learn that trick!\n\nPerformer(to the crowd): Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!\n\n",

"Aang(raising his hand and waving it about): Oh! Oh! Me! Me!\n\nSokka: What do you think you're doing?\n\n",

"Aang: I want to get a closer look.\n\nKatara: It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.\n\n",

"Performer(pointing at Katara): How about you, little lady?\n\nKatara(backing away and shaking her head): Uh\n\n",

"Performer: Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!\n\nAang: Awww! That could'a been me.\n\n",

"Aang: We gotta help her!\n\nSokka: No, we don't want to make a scene!\n\nPerformer: The rope, it's breaking!\n\n",

"Sokka: I think it's time to go.\n\nChey(from o.c.): Follow me! I can git ya outta here!\n\nGuard: There they are!\n\n",

"Sokka: I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!\n\nAang: Nice touch setting off the fireworks.\n\n",

"Sokka: You seem to really know your explosives.\n\nChey (turning to them): I'm familiar.\n\n",

"Sokka(surprised): You're a Fire Nation soldier!\n\nChey: Was. My name's Chey.\n\n",

"Aang: You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? (Standing up) We've gotta go see him! He can train me!\n\nSokka: We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!\n\n",

"Aang(hurt): Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me.\n\nKatara(standing up as well): It can't hurt just to talk to him.\n\n",

"Aang: What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?\n\nChey(sitting down glumly): He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here. He wants you to leave immediately.\n\n",

"Sokka(getting up on his elbows): Finally! Let's hit the road.(He stretches back out again.)\n\nAang: Why won't he see me?\n\n",

"Chey: He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.\n\nAang: Wait, how does he know that?\n\n",

"Chey: He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.\n\nAang: I'm going in anyway!\n\n",

"Jeong Jeong: Get out.\n\nAang: Master, I need to learn firebending.\n\nJeong Jeong: Only a fool seeks his own destruction.\n\n",

"Aang: Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.\n\nJeong Jeong: To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.\n\n",

"Avatar Roku: You think I am weak?\n\nJeong Jeong: Avatar Roku! No! No! (inclining his head in respect) I did not mean that!\n\nJeong Jeong(coming out of his trance): Yes, yes, I will teach you.\n\n",

"Aang: Really? That's great!\n\nJeong Jeong(looking at Aang's enormous, cheesy smile): Ughhhhh.\n\n",

"Jeong Jeong: Widen your stance.(Aang complies.)Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. (Aang takes on an expression of concentration.) Good, good!\n\nAang(as Jeong Jeong begins to walk away): Wait! What do I do now?\n\n",

"Jeong Jeong(whipping around, Katara and Sokka visible in the background): Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking? (Then, pointing to Sokka) Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!\n\n",

"Sokka(from afar): Hey!\n\nAang: But what am I concentrating on?\n\n",

"Jeong Jeong: Concentrate!\n\nAang: Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?\n\nJeong Jeong: No fire yet.\n\n",

"Aang(clearly disappointed and impatient): What?\n\nJeong Jeong: Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.\n\n",

"Aang: You brought me up here to breathe?\n\nJeong Jeong: Assume your stance.\n\nJeong Jeong: Wider.\n\nAang: You're not even look...\n\n",

"Aang: I've been breathing for hours.\n\nJeong Jeong: You want to stop breathing?\n\n",

"Aang: I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.\n\nJeong Jeong: We're going to work with fire now.\n\n",

"Aang: Oh yeh!\n\nAang: I mean, let us begin.\n\n",

"Jeong Jeong: Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep this flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.\n\n",


"Aang: I did it! I made fire!\n\nKatara(coming closer): Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.\n\nKatara: Careful!\n\n",

"Aang: Now that's firebending!\n\nKatara: Aang, you'll hurt yourself!\n\nAang(continuing to play): Wonder how that juggler did it?\n\nAang: Katara! (He hops over to her as she cries pitifully) I'm so sorry!\n\n",

"Sokka(rushing into the frame): Katara, what's wrong!? (To Aang, angrily) What did you do?\n\nAang: Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so -\n\n",

"Sokka: You burned my sister! (Shot widens more to show Jeong Jeong has returned. Then, to Jeong Jeong) This is all your fault!\n\nJeong Jeong: I know. Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.\n\n",


"Aang: No, never again.\n\nKatara: It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.\n\nAang: What? How?\n\nKatara: I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!\n\n",

"Katara: By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.\n\nAang(running out of the hut): I have to help him!\n\n",

"Jeong Jeong: That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!\n\nZhao(laughing): I think I can handle a child.\n\n",

"Aang: YOU were Jeong Jeong's student?\n\nZhao: Until I got bored.\n\n",

"Zhao: I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!\n\n",

"Aang: Whoa! Wild shot!\n\nZhao: I'll show you wild!\n\nAang(to himself): No self control...\n\nZhao: Stand and fight, Avatar!\n\nAang: Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.\n\n",

"Aang: Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!\n\nAang: Ahoy! (Sticking his butt out at the admiral and wiggling it suggestively) I'm Admiral Zhao!\n\n",

"Aang: I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.\n\nAang: Sloppy. Very sloppy.\n\n",

"Aang: Wow! That's good water.\n\nSokka: When did you learn how to do that?\n\nKatara(shrugging): I guess I always knew.\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!\n\n",

"Aang: Two?\n\nKatara: He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh, and the time that big snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.\n\n",

"Aang: Aren't airbender stories the best?\n\nKatara: Was it realistic? Was that how it was back then?\n\n",

"Aang: I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.\n\nStoryteller: Jingle, jingle!\n\n",

"Sokka: Sorry!\n\nStoryteller: Aww. Cheapskates!\n\nAang: Hey thanks for the story!\n\n",

"Katara(sitting down next to Sokka): Do you think we'll really find airbenders?\n\nSokka(whittling): You want me to be like you, or totally honest?\n\n",

"Katara(folding her arms): Are you saying I'm a liar?\n\nSokka: I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically.\n\n",

"Aang: Hey guys, look at this!\n\nKatara: Huh! They really are airbenders!\n\n",

"Aang(leaning back and folding his arms unhappily): No, they're not.\n\n",

"Sokka(appearing in the far background with Momo and pointing ahead): What do you mean they're not? Those guys are flying!\n\n",

"Aang(from o.c. as the camera returns to a shot of the temple and its gliders): Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move. They're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.\n\n",

"Katara(pointing to the glider): I don't know, Aang. That kid seems pretty spirited!\n\n",

"Sokka: We better find some solid ground before it finds us!\n\n",

"Audience Member: Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!\n\nTeo: Hey there! You're pretty good.\n\n",

"Aang: Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!\n\nTeo: Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...\n\n",

"Teo: What do you think?\n\nAang(clearly not enthused): It's great.\n\n",

"Teo: Hey! You're a REAL airbender! You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.\n\nAang(looking embarrassed but happy): Thanks.\n\n",

"Sokka: Wow! This glider chair is incredible!\n\nTeo: If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.\n\n",

"Aang: This place is unbelievable.\n\nTeo: Yeh, it's great isn't it?\n\nAang: No, just unbelievable.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.\n\nSokka: So better!\n\n",

"Aang(sadly from o.c. as the camera pans the mural): This is supposed to be the history of my people.\n\nAang(as the smoke erupts from the statue): Ugh!\n\n",

"Katara: I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.\n\nAang: It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.\n\n",

"Voice: Look out!\n\nThe Mechanist: What the doodle! Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse!\n\n",

"Aang: This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way. I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.\n\nThe Mechanist: The monks? But you're 12!\n\n",

"Aang: Nature knows where to stop.\n\n",

"Sokka(approaching the candles): Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.\n\nThe Mechanist: The candle will tell us. Watch.\n\n",

"The Mechanist: Four flashes, so it's exactly four hours past midday, or, as I call it, four o'candle!\n\n",

"Sokka(after catching the fingers): Aaahhh!\n\nThe Mechanist: Follow me!\n\n",

"Katara: Aang?\n\nAang(lowering his head): I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.\n\n",

"Teo: I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.\n\nAang: Thanks.\n\nSokka: These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.\n\n",

"Sokka: Why would you want to use fireflies for light?\n\nThe Mechanist: Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose. Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.\n\n",

"The Mechanist: Cover your nose and hold your breath.\n\nSokka: Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.\n\n",

"Sokka(checking his part of the door for leaks): So this place is an explosion waiting to happen?\n\nThe Mechanist: Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell or touch.\n\n",

"Aang: That's the something you're talking about.\n\nTeo: Yeh, I suppose it is.\n\nTeo: Are you ready?\n\nKatara: No!\n\n",

"Katara: I can't believe I'm flying!\n\nAang: Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!\n\n",

"Katara: Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.\n\nAang: Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.\n\n",

"Aang: I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.\n\nTeo: Great!\n\n",

"Katara(her voice echoing from o.c.): Wait! How do I land this thing? What if I land (swallows bug) – eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug!\n\n",

"Sokka(sniffing the air): Ugh! Week old egg smell!\n\nThe Mechanist: Quick! Find that egg!\n\nTeo: I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside.\n\n",

"Sokka: How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!\n\nThe Mechanist(getting an idea): That's the solution to our problem!\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeh!\n\nSokka: If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...\n\n",

"The Mechanist: The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs...\n\nSokka: Then, if there's a leak...\n\n",

"The Mechanist: You smell rotten eggs! Then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from...\n\nSokka: And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!\n\n",

"Both: You're a genius!\n\nThe Mechanist(getting up and running): Something's wrong I've got to go.\n\n",

"Aang: This is a nightmare.\n\nThe Mechanist (entering behind them): You don't understand.\n\n",

"Aang (turning and pointing a finger at him in anger): You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!\n\nSokka (angry): You make weapons for the Fire Nation!?\n\n",

"The Mechanist: Soon.(He looks at a clock candle which sparks once.)Very soon.\n\nAang: You can't give them more weapons.\n\n",

"The Mechanist: I need some time to think.(After a pause, a little tinkling bell is heard.)You need to leave! Go!\n\nTeo: We're not leaving!\n\n",

"The Mechanist (from o.c.): We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka.\n\n",

"The Mechanist: This boy's a genius!\n\nSokka: Thank you. You're a genius!\n\nThe Mechanist: Thank you!\n\n",

"Sokka: A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.(He demonstrates by pulling a string connected to the lid that opens and closes it.)\n\n",

"Katara: Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.\n\nSokka: Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...\n\nThe Mechanist: ...stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!\n\n",

"Teo: Are we ready?\n\nKatara: Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?\n\n",

"Aang: We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!\n\nKatara: Those things are unstoppable!\n\n",

"Katara: Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?\n\nSokka: Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?\n\n",

"The Mechanist(cut to a view of the Fire Nation symbol): The insignia! They think we're on their side!\n\n",

"Sokka(cutting a rope with his knife): Then I guess they won't see this coming.\n\n",

"The Mechanist: Bomb away!\n\nSokka: Oh no! That was the last one!\n\nThe Mechanist: Wait a second, (he sniffs the air) you smell that?\n\n",

"Sokka: Rotten eggs!\n\nSokka: There! That's where the gas is escaping!\n\n",

"The Mechanist: What are you doing!? That's our fuel source!\n\nSokka: It's the only bomb we've got!\n\n",

"Aang: Look! They're retreating!\n\nAll: Yeh!!!\n\nSokka: We're going down!\n\n",

"Katara: No! Sokka! Hold on!\n\nSokka: Get ready!\n\n",

"Aang: You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. It's like the hermit crab (he picks one up from the stone bench.), maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other.\n\n",

"Teo: That means a lot coming from you.\n\nSokka: Aang, you were right about air power. (Pointing to the sky) As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!\n\n",

"Sokka(petulantly): I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?\n\nAang: I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?\n\n",

"Sokka: I'd love to! Climb on everyone (he wiggles his butt at everyone), Sokka's ready for takeoff!\n\nKatara: Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.\n\n",

"Sokka: And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.\n\nKatara: They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!\n\n",

"Zhao: He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.\n\nCaptain Li: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!\n\n",

"Katara(from o.c. with wonder): The Northern Water Tribe...\n\nSokka: We're finally here...\n\nKatara: I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!\n\n",

"Aang: We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!\n\nKatara (from o.c.): This place is beautiful.\n\n",

"Sokka(looking dreamily at the girl as he boat moves away): Yeh, she is.\n\n",

"Iroh(singing slightly out of tune): Winter, spring, summer and fall. Wi/bnter and spring, summer and fall. Four seasons, four loves. Four seasons, four loves.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Thank you, father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times.\n\nChief Arnook: Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!\n\n",

"Sokka(in a cheesy voice): Hi, there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.\n\nPrincess Yue(smiling and bowing slightly): Very nice to meet you.\n\n",

"Sokka(after a brief pause, trying desperately to strike up a conversation): So... uh... you're a Princess! (She nods and smiles) You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!\n\nKatara: Ha! Prince of what?\n\n",

"Sokka (angry): A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!\n\nKatara (with a mock bow): My apologies, Prince Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka (turning back to Yue and trying to recover): So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile. I'm thinking maybe we could...(then lamely) do an activity together?\n\nPrincess Yue: Do an “activity”?\n\nKatara: Very smooth.\n\n",

"Chief Arnook: Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.\n\nMaster Pakku: Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.\n\n",

"Aang (trying to ignore this): My friend and I can't wait to start training with you – after we relax for a couple days.\n\nMaster Pakku: If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.\n\n",

"Zuko: For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.\n\nIroh: No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.\n\n",

"Zhao: I'm taking your crew.\n\nZuko (turning to face Zhao): What!?\n\nZhao: I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.\n\n",

"Zhao: Uncle, is that true?\n\nIroh: I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone.(Putting his arm over his face in woe)Even the cook!\n\n",

"Zhao: I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.\n\nZuko: I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.\n\n",

"Zhao: Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?\n\nIroh: Just rumors. I don't think he is real.\n\n",

"Katara: I've waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!\n\nAang: Good morning, Master Pakku!\n\n",

"Master Pakku(dropping the water blob with a grimace): No, please, march right in, I'm not concentrating or anything.\n\nAang: Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?\n\n",

"Katara: What do you mean you won't teach me? (Walking up to Pakku) I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”!\n\nMaster Pakku: No.\n\n",

"Katara(hands on her hips): But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!\n\nMaster Pakku: Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.\n\n",

"Katara: I don't want to heal, I want to fight!\n\nMaster Pakku: I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.\n\n",

"Katara: Well your rules stink!\n\nAang: Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then –\n\nMaster Pakku(standing up): Then what?\n\nAang: Then I won't learn from you!\n\n",

"Master Pakku: Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.\n\nKatara: Wait! (To Pakku) Aang didn't mean that.\n\n",

"Katara: You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.\n\nMaster Pakku: Why don't we get started then.\n\n",

"Sokka: Princess Yue! Good morning! Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.\n\nPrincess Yue: I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.\n\n",

"Sokka: Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.\n\nSokka: So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.\n\nPrincess Yue: Do an “activity”, you mean?\n\nSokka: Yes! At... a place! For... some time!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: I'd love to!(She points ahead, cut to a shot of a bridge in front of them, she continues from o.c.)I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.\n\n",

"Zhao: You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.\n\nPirate Barker: That's some tasty gold!\n\nZhao (smiling): I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko?\n\n",

"Katara: Um, hi. Are you Yagoda?\n\nYugoda: Are you here for the healing lesson?\n\nKatara (walking forward and sitting down): I guess I am.\n\nYugoda: Welcome! Welcome!\n\n",

"Master Pakku: You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.\n\nAang(through gritted teeth): I'm trying!\n\nMaster Pakku: Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?\n\n",

"Katara: Thanks for the lesson.\n\nYugoda: So, who's the lucky boy?\n\nKatara: Huh?\n\nYugoda(pointing at her neck): Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?\n\n",

"Katara: No, I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace, and my mother passed it down to me.\n\nYugoda: I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner! You're the spitting image of Kana!\n\n",

"Katara (starting backwards in surprise): Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?\n\nYugoda: When I was about your age I was friends with Kana. She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.\n\n",

"Katara (looking away): She never told me.\n\nYugoda: Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.\n\n",

"Katara: If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?\n\nYugoda: I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.\n\n",

"Iroh: The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.\n\nZuko: Good riddance to those traitors.\n\nIroh: It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.\n\n",

"Pirate Barker(whispering): Careful with the blasting jelly!\n\nZuko (getting up): Uncle? (Opening his door to look out into the corridor) Uncle, is that you?\n\n",

"Iroh: Zuko!\n\nIroh (lowering his face in sadness): Zuko...\n\n",

"Sokka: Hi, Princess Yue. (Offering her something) I made you something. I carved it myself.\n\nPrincess Yue: It's a bear.\n\nSokka: Actually, it's a fish (he turns it sideways), see it has a fin.\n\n",

"Katara: How's warrior training going?\n\nAang: That bad?\n\nSokka: No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it. One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!(Pause.)So how's waterbending training?\n\n",

"Aang: Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.\n\nSokka: Why don't you just teach her, Aang?\n\n",

"Katara: Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku. That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending. Everyone's happy!\n\n",

"Sokka: I'm not happy.\n\nKatara: But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.\n\n",

"Aang: Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.\n\nKatara: I got it!\n\nAang: That was amazing!\n\nKatara: That wasn't me.\n\nMaster Pakku: You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.\n\n",

"Aang: I'm sorry, I –\n\nMaster Pakku: You are no longer welcome as my student.\n\n",

"Chief Arnook: What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?\n\nKatara: Yes – please!\n\nChief Arnook: I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.\n\n",

"Katara: Fine.\n\nMaster Pakku: I'm waiting, little girl.\n\nKatara: No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!\n\nAang: Uh, Katara...\n\n",

"Katara (a look of challenge on her face):I'll be outside – if you're man enough to fight me!\n\nAang: I'm sure she didn't mean that.\n\nSokka: Yeh, I think she did.\n\n",

"Zhao: I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. (Cheesily) Just devastated.\n\nIroh(opening his eyes): The Fire Lord will not be pleased he learns who was responsible.\n\n",

"Zhao(suspicious, frowning): You know who... was behind the attack?\n\nIroh: Yes... (slamming table with his fist) pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.\n\n",

"Iroh: They wanted revenge.\n\nZhao (after taking a sip of tea): So, have you reconsidered my offer?\n\n",

"Iroh (bowing): Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. (Raising his glass in a toast) To the Fire Nation!\n\nZhao(raising his glass): To victory!\n\n",

"Sokka: Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!\n\nKatara (taking off her coat and throwing it at Sokka, hitting him in the face): I know! I don't care!\n\n",

"Aang: You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.\n\nKatara: I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!\n\n",

"Katara: So, you decided to show up? (He walks past her.) Aren't you gonna fight?\n\nMaster Pakku(without turning): Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.\n\n",

"Master Pakku(mockingly): Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!\n\nKatara: You can't knock me down!\n\nAang: Go Katara!\n\n",

"Master Pakku: Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.\n\nKatara: But you still won't teach me, will you?\n\n",

"Master Pakku: No.\n\nMaster Pakku(walking towards her): This fight is over.\n\nKatara: Come back here! I'm not finished yet!\n\n",

"Master Pakku(in wonder): This is my necklace!\n\nKatara: No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!\n\n",

"Katara: My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?\n\nIroh: Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.\n\nZuko(removing his guard mask): You didn't have to do this.\n\n",

"Iroh: No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!\n\nZuko: Thank you, Uncle.\n\n",

"Iroh (hearing a sound): Someone's coming! (Zuko replaces his mask) Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours! Good luck!\n\n",

"Master Pakku (still holding the necklace, sadly): I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.\n\nKatara: But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.\n\n",

"Katara(walking up to Pakku): Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.\n\n",

"Aang: Go get her.\n\nPrincess Yue: What do you want from me?\n\nSokka: Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful... and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: You don't understand.\n\nSokka: No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.\n\nPrincess Yue: No, Sokka...\n\n",

"Sokka: It's okay. You don't have to say anything. (Turning to leave) I'll see ya around, okay?\n\n",

"Sokka: Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy – but confused!\n\nPrincess Yue: I do like you! A lot. But, we can't be together – and not for the reason you think. It's because... (she pulls down the collar of her coat to reveal a necklace) ...I'm engaged. I'm sorry!\n\n",

"Master Pakku: Not bad! Not bad! Heheh! Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age!\n\nAang: Hey Katara!\n\n",

"Aang: Good to see ya here.\n\nKatara(smiling): You too.\n\n",

"Master Pakku: Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?\n\n",

"Master Pakku(voice over): Pupil Aang!\n\nAang: Yes, Master Pakku?\n\n",

"Master Pakku: Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets you must have already mastered waterbending.\n\nAang: I wouldn't say \"mastered\", but check this out!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?\n\nSokka(stopping and sitting down on the rail): Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Sokka, this is wrong.\n\nSokka: What's wrong? We're taking a walk!\n\nPrincess Yue: I'm engaged. It just... feels...\n\n",

"Sokka: I know what you need! You need to meet my good friend Appa!\n\nPrincess Yue: Who?\n\nSokka: Appa and I go way back. Don't we boy?\n\nSokka: Ahh!Easy!\n\nSokka: Downboy! Ahh! No! Up!\n\nPrincess Yue: Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: So how does this work?\n\nSokka: You hangin' on tight?\n\nPrincess Yue: Mmm hmm.\n\nSokka: Yip... (Cut to a close up of Sokka's face) ...yip!\n\nPrincess Yue: Oh...my...goodness!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Wow! (Blushing slightly) I can't believe you do this every day!\n\nSokka (stretching): Yeh, we pretty much live up here.\n\nPrincess Yue(hugging herself): Is it always this cold in the sky?\n\nSokka: Not when you're with someone.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: It's beautiful up here.\n\nSokka: Yeh.\n\nSokka: Whoo! Yeh! Good times! Good times!\n\nSokka (pointing down): Hey, look!\n\nPrincess Yue: What's happening?\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh no.\n\nSokka: Soot.\n\nPrincess Yue: What?\n\nSokka: I've seen it before. Right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow.\n\nSokka: It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole. And from the looks of the stuff...\n\n",

"Zhao: This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh.\n\n",

"Zhao: Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it.\n\nIroh: Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.\n\n",

"Zhao: I suppose you speak from experience? But rest assured, this will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba-Sing-Se.\n\nIroh: I hope not, for your sake.\n\n",

"Iroh(whispering): We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?\n\nZuko (removing his mask): I'm working on it, Uncle.\n\n",

"Sokka: What's wrong? (Pointing up to the citadel) We have to go!\n\nPrincess Yue(releasing his grip on her hand): No, Sokka, wait. I can't see you anymore. Not at all.\n\nSokka (turning in surprise): What? We're just friends.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else.\n\nSokka: You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: But I do love my people.\n\nSokka: You're not marrying them.\n\nPrincess Yue: You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. (Running off screen, barely holding back tears) I have to do this, goodbye!\n\n",

"Aang: I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. I'm gonna make a difference this time.\n\nAang: Yip! Yip!\n\n",

"Aang: I'll take it from here, boy!\n\nAang: Appa!\n\nAang: Thanks for the rescue, buddy!\n\n",

"Hahn: What's your problem?\n\nSokka(pointing at him): Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.\n\nHahn: Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.\n\nSokka: When, like a hundred years ago?\n\n",

"Chief Arnook: Eighty five.\n\nSokka(walking forward): The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.\n\n",

"Sokka: Princess Yue's marrying you?\n\nHahn: Yeh, what of it?\n\nSokka(turning away): Nothing, congratulations.\n\n",

"Iroh: It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack. The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.\n\n",

"Zhao: Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: They've stopped firing.\n\nKatara(pointing at them): Aang!\n\nAang: I can't do it.(Putting his hands to his head.)I can't do it.\n\n",

"Katara: What happened?\n\nAang: I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: But, you have to! You're the Avatar!\n\nAang: I'm just one kid.\n\n",

"Iroh: If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew, you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.\n\nZuko: I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.\n\n",

"Iroh: I'm sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son...\n\nZuko: Uncle, you don't have to say it.\n\nIroh: I think of you as my own.\n\n",

"Zuko: I know, Uncle.(He bows and salutes him with his arm over chest.)We'll meet again...\n\nZuko (releasing his Uncle and walking over to the canoe): ...after I have the Avatar.\n\n",

"Iroh: Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!\n\nZuko: I will.\n\nIroh: And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!\n\nZuko (now far below his uncle): I'll be fine.\n\n",

"Sokka (his eyes bulging in anger): Perks!? What does that mean?\n\nHahn: I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll get with the Chief aren't bad either.\n\nSokka: Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!\n\n",

"Hahn: Whoa. Hang on. What do you care? You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense.\n\nSokka: You're just a jerk without a soul! No offense!\n\n",

"Hahn: All right, fall in men! Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Jo in no time.\n\nSokka(to the backs of Hahn and his departing soldiers): It's Admiral Zhao!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves.\n\nKatara: I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon, our life comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance.\n\nAang: The Spirits! Maybe I can find them and get their help!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: How can you do that?\n\nKatara: The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World. Aang can talk to them!\n\n",

"Princess Yue(smiling hopefully): Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!\n\nAang (spreading his arms wide): Or, maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation!\n\nAang: Or wisdom. That's good too.\n\n",

"Katara: The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?\n\nPrincess Yue: I have an idea, follow me.\n\n",

"Aang: So is this the way to the Spirit World?\n\nPrincess Yue: No, you'll have to get there on your own. (Opening the door) But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole.\n\n",

"Aang: I never thought I'd miss grass this much!\n\nKatara(smiling): It's so warm here! How is that possible?(She takes off her overcoat.)\n\nPrincess Yue: It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.\n\n",

"Zuko(to the noisy turtles): Be quiet!\n\n",

"Chief Arnook: Is something wrong, Sokka?\n\nSokka: Oh no! Hahn's out there on the top secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine!\n\n",

"Chief Arnook: Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you.\n\nSokka (turning to the Chief in anger): What? You want me to scrub the barracks?\n\n",

"Chief Arnook: I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.\n\nSokka (getting up, an look of innocence mingled with desire on his face): Er, sure. That shouldn't be too hard.\n\n",

"Princess Yue(trying to whisper): Why is he sitting like that?\n\nKatara (also whispering): He's meditating – trying to cross over into the Spirit World. It takes all his concentration.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Is there any way we can help?\n\nAang: How 'bout some quiet!?(Turning to look at them, Katara putting a hand over her mouth.)C'mon guys! I can hear every word you're saying!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Is he okay?\n\nKatara: He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. That's his way back to the physical world.\n\n",

"Princess Yue(beginning to walk away): Maybe we should get some help?\n\nKatara: No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.\n\n",

"Zuko (voice over, his voice echoing slightly in the chamber): Well, aren't you a big girl now?\n\nKatara (turning to the voice): No!\n\n",

"Zuko: Yes! Hand him over, and I won't have to hurt you.\n\nZuko (getting up): I see you've learned a new trick. But I didn't come this far to lose to you.\n\nZuko: You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?\n\n",

"Zuko: You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.\n\n",

"Katara(shouting): Aang!\n\nSokka: What happened? Where's Zuko?\n\nKatara(sadly): He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.\n\nSokka: Where did they go?\n\n",

"Katara: I can't believe I lost him.\n\nSokka: You did everything you could and now we need to do everything we can to get him back.\n\n",

"Sokka (continuing from o.c.): Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.\n\nKatara (getting up):Okay.\n\n",

"Katara: It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.\n\nSokka: Yip! Yip!\n\n",

"Mystical Monkey: Ohmmmm...\n\nAang: Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you, but I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean spirits.\n\nMystical Monkey: Go... away.\n\nMystical Monkey: You're still here?\n\nAang: Yes! I need –\n\nMystical Monkey: Ohmm!! Ohmmm!\n\n",

"Avatar Roku: The spirit's name is Koh. But he is very dangerous. They call him... the Face Stealer.\n\n",

"Avatar Roku: When you speak with him you must be very careful to show no emotion at all – not the slightest expression or he will steal your face!\n\n",

"Zuko: I finally have you. But I can't get you home because of this blizzard. There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always...came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy – and everyone adores her.",

"Zuko: My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck though, I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am.\n\n",

"Iroh: I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises they will be undefeatable.\n\n",

"Zhao: I assure you I have everything under control. I intend to remove the moon as a factor.\n\nIroh: Remove the moon!? How?\n\nIroh (angry): Zhao, the Spirits are not to be trifled with!\n\n",

"Aang (in unison with voice over from Roku): Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.\n\nKoh: Welcome!\n\nAang: Thank you.\n\nKoh: My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.\n\n",

"Aang: You know me?\n\nKoh (now facing the camera, away from Aang): How could I forget...\n\nZuko: Guess we'll be here awhile.\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Don't worry! Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather.\n\nKatara: I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.\n\n",

"Sokka: They're not gonna die in this blizzard. If we know anything it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive – and we'll find them!\n\n",

"Koh: It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection.(His face is now that of an owl)So... how may I help you?\n\nAang: I need to find the Moon and the Ocean.\n\n",

"Koh: Their spirit names are Tui and La. Push... and Pull... and that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.\n\nAang: Please, help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.\n\n",

"Koh: Oh, you think you need their help? Actually, it's quite the other way around.\n\nAang: What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?\n\nKoh: You've already met them, actually.\n\n",

"Koh: Tui and La, your Moon and Ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other... push and pull... life and death... good and evil... yin... and yang.\n\nAang (smiling): The koi fish!\n\n",

"Aang: Momo!\n\nAang (looking at his hands): Momo?(Realizing his predicament)Oh no! Where's my body?\n\n",

"Zuko: Welcome back.\n\nAang (threateningly): Good to be back.\n\nZuko: That won't be enough to escape.\n\n",

"Aang: Appa!\n\nZuko (assuming a firebending stance): Here for a rematch?\n\nKatara (beginning to waterbend): Trust me, Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.\n\n",

"Sokka: Hey! This is some quality rope!\n\nAang: We need to get to the oasis! The spirits are in trouble!\n\nAang: Wait, we can't just leave him here.\n\n",

"Sokka: Sure we can. Let's go.\n\nAang: No, if we leave him, he'll die.\n\nSokka: Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: Ugh...\n\nSokka: Are you okay?\n\nPrincess Yue: I feel faint.\n\n",

"Aang (his hand on his head as well):I feel it too.(Aang's looks up)The Moon Spirit is in trouble.\n\nPrincess Yue: I owe the Moon Spirit my life.\n\n",

"Sokka: What do you mean?\n\nPrincess Yue: When I was born I was very sick and very weak. Most babies cry when they're born...\n\n",

"Princess Yue: ...but I was born as if I were asleep. My eyes closed.\n\nPrincess Yue: Our healers did everything they could. They told my mother and father I was going to die.\n\n",

"Zhao: Don't bother!\n\nAang: Zhao! Don't!\n\nZhao: It's my destiny... to destroy the Moon... and the Water Tribe.\n\nAang: Destroying the moon won't just hurt the Water Tribe. It will hurt everyone – including you.",

"Zhao: General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?\n\nIroh: I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon too. We all depend on the balance.\n\n",

"Iroh: Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold!(He assumes a firebending stance)LET IT GO, NOW!\n\n",

"Princess Yue: There's no hope now. It's over.\n\nAang (voice deep and other-worldly): No, it's not over.\n\n",

"Zhao (incredulously): You're alive?\n\nZuko: You tried to have me killed!\n\nZhao (with much venom): Yes, I did. You're the Blue Spirit – and enemy of the Fire Nation!\n\n",

"Zhao: You freed the Avatar!\n\nZuko: I had no choice!\n\nZhao: You should have chosen to accept your failure – your disgrace! Then, at least you could have lived!\n\n",

"Katara: It's too late. It's dead.\n\nIroh: You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you!\n\nPrincess Yue(looking up): Yes, you're right. It gave me life. Maybe I can give it back.\n\n",

"Sokka (reaching for her): No! You don't have to do that!\n\nPrincess Yue(holding his hand behind her, but looking down): It's my duty, Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka: I won't let you! Your father told me to protect you!\n\nPrincess Yue(looking up): I have to do this.\n\nSokka (in despair): NO!\n\nSokka (softly): She's gone.(He hugs her body tightly)She's gone.\n\n",

"Princess Yue / Moon Spirit: Goodbye, Sokka. I will always be with you.\n\n",

"Katara: What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.\n\nMaster Pakku: Well, then he better get used to calling you \"Master Katara.\"\n\n",

"Sokka: You must be proud.\n\nChief Arnook:So proud. And sad.\n\n",

"Iroh: I'm surprised, Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.\n\nZuko: I'm tired.\n\nIroh: Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.\n\n",

"Katara: You too, Momo.\n\nAang (extending a forearm and laughing): Come here.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: Iroh is a traitor and your brother Zuko is a failure.(Cut to a close up of Azula's face as she looks up at her father with a smile)I have a task for you...\n\n",

"Aang:(as he falls)Aaahhh!(he lands on the floor of the Air Temple)Oof!\n\nKatara:Aang?\n\nKatara:Do you wanna talk about it?\n\nAang:Nah. Just a nightmare.\n\n",

"Master Pakku:(in a serious and ceremonial manner)Katara, I want you to have this. This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. The water has unique properties. Don't lose it.\n\nKatara:(respectfully)Thank you, Master Pakku.\n\n",

"Aang:Appa, yip yip!\n\nKatara: Say hi to Gran Gran for me!\n\nIroh: Aaahhh... this is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?\n\n",

"Iroh:I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?\n\nZuko: Three years ago today I was banished. I lost it all.(He looks up suddenly.)I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my honor, I want my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless.\n\n",

"Iroh:(with exaggerated optimism)I'm sure he doesn't! Why would he banish you if he didn't care?\n\nIroh:(negatively to himself)Erg... that came out wrong, didn't it?\n\n",

"Azula: My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord and brought shame on all of us. You may have mixed feelings about attacking members of the royal family; I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed.\n\n",

"Azula:I'm sorry, Captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Can you explain something to me?\n\nCaptain:Of course, Your Highness.\n\nAzula:Do the tides command this ship?\n\n",

"Captain:Uh... I'm afraid I do not understand.\n\nAzula:(condescendingly)You said the tides would notallowus to bring the ship in. Do the tides command this ship?\n\n",

"Captain:No, Princess.\n\nAzula:And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore?\n\nCaptain:(nervously)No, Princess.\n\n",

"Azula:Well, then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who've already made up their mind about killing you and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over.\n\nCaptain: I'll pull us in.\n\n",

"Sokka:(excitedly)There it is!\n\nGeneral Fong:(graciously)Welcome, Avatar Aang!\n\nGeneral Fong:I am General Fong. And welcome to all of you, great heroes! Appa, Momo, brave Sokka, the mighty Katara.\n\n",

"Katara:(pleased)\"Mighty Katara\"? I like that.\n\nSokka:Not bad, not bad.\n\n",

"Aang:(humbly)I try not to think about it too much.\n\nGeneral Fong:Avatar... you're ready to face the Fire Lord now.\n\nAang:(alarmed)What?! No I'm not!\n\nKatara:Aang still needs to master all four elements.\n\n",

"General Fong:Why?(becomes worked up as he speaks and rises from his desk)With the kind of power he possesses—power enough to destroy hundreds of battleships in a matter of minutes—he could defeat the Fire Lord now!\n\n",

"General Fong:So it's decided then. I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar state, and then you'll face your destiny.\n\nKatara:(irritated)No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.\n\n",

"Elder 1:Almost perfect.\n\nElder 2:One hair out of place.\n\nAzula:'Almost' isn't good enough!\n\n",

"Aang:(o.c.)General Fong?\n\nGeneral Fong:(warmly)Come in, Aang. Have you thought about our discussion?\n\n",

"Aang:(quietly)I told the general I'd help him... by going into the Avatar state.\n\nKatara:Aang, no. This is not the right way.\n\n",

"Sokka:Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? He was incredible.\n\nKatara:There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline.\n\n",

"Sokka:Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord.\n\nKatara:(angrily)If you two meatheads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine. Go ahead and glow it up!(She exits to the right. Aang rises and starts after her.)\n\n",

"Sokka:(Looking bored.)I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.\n\nAang:(collides with a column, his air ball disappear and his shawl falling over his head.)Ooof!\n\n",

"Sokka:Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar state.\n\nAang:(cheerfully)I love surprises.\n\nMomo:Raahh!\n\nAang:Aaahhh!(looks at his hands and holds them up)Still not glowing.\n\n",

"Aang:This is just mud!\n\nPriest:So... do you feel anything?\n\nAang:Aaaaachoooo!\n\nGeneral Fong:(determined)We have to find a way.\n\n",

"Iroh:Look at these magnificent shells! I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.\n\nZuko:We don't need anymore useless things. You forget we have to carry everything ourselves now.\n\n",

"Azula:(o.c.)Hello, brother. Uncle.\n\nZuko:(accusingly)What are you doing here?\n\n",

"Azula:(arrogantly)In my country, we exchange a pleasant 'hello' before asking questions.(She gets up and walks over to face Zuko.)Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?\n\nZuko:(furiously)Don't call me that!\n\n",

"Iroh:To what do we owe this honor?\n\nAzula:Hmm... must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the point.",

"Azula: Family are the only ones you can really trust. Father regrets your banishment. He wants you home.\n\nAzula: Did you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful.(Camera returns to show her pleasant expression.)I just gave you great news.\n\n",

"Iroh:I'm sure your brother just needs a moment to—\n\nAzula: Don't interrupt, Uncle! I still haven't heard my thank you. I am not a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way.\n\n",

"Zuko:(with shocked and quiet disbelief)Father regrets? He... wants me back?\n\nAzula:I can see you need time to take this in. I'll come to call on you tomorrow. Good evening.(Azula walks off screen to the right.)\n\n",

"Aang:I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.\n\nKatara:I don't understand.\n\n",

"Aang:No, you don't. Every day more and more people die. I'm already a hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it.\n\n",

"Iroh:(skeptically)It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything.\n\nZuko:Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him. He cares about me.\n\n",

"Iroh:I care about you. And if Ozai wants you back... well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.\n\nZuko: You don't know how my father feels about me. You don't know anything.\n\n",

"Aang:(softly)Sokka. Sokka, wake up.\n\nSokka:(groggily)Wha...?\n\nAang:I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar state.\n\nSokka:You sure?\n\nAang:Yes.\n\nSokka:(accepting)Okay.\n\n",

"Aang:(apprehensive)Do you think the general will be mad?\n\nSokka:What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you?\n\n",

"Zuko:(happily surprised)Uncle! You've changed your mind!\n\nIroh:Family sticks together, right?\n\nZuko:We're finally going home.\n\n",

"Aang:The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So, I guess that's it.\n\nGeneral Fong:Sure I can't change your mind?\n\n",

"Aang:I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar state when I'm in genuine danger.\n\nGeneral Fong:I see. I was afraid you'd say that.\n\n",

"Aang:(about to hit the ground)Aaahhh!\n\nGeneral Fong:Men! Attack the Avatar!\n\nAang:What are you doing?\n\nGeneral Fong:I believe we are about to get results.\n\n",

"Aang:I am not your enemy! I won't fight you!\n\nGeneral Fong:You can't run forever!\n\nAang:You can't fight forever!\n\n",

"Azula:Brother! Uncle! Welcome. I'm so glad you decided to come.\n\nAzula:(pleasantly)Set our course for home, Captain.\n\nCaptain: You heard the princess! Raise the anchors! We're taking the prisoners ho—(stops abruptly, realizing his mistake)\n\n",

"Captain:(mortified)Your Highness... I...\n\nZuko:You lied to me!\n\nAzula:(smugly)Like I've never done that before.\n\nAang:Aaahhh!\n\n",

"Katara:(to Sokka)What's going on?\n\nSokka:The general's gone crazy. He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar state!\n\n",

"General Fong:Maybe you can avoid me, but she can't.\n\nKatara:Aaahhh!(grunts, straining)I can't move!\n\nAang:Don't hurt her!\n\nKatara:(sinking deeper)Aaahhh!\n\n",

"Sokka:Katara! No!(Fong sinks the bird creature's legs into the dirt and Sokka gets tossed from his ostrich, landing in the hole of one of the discs.)Waaaahhh! Oof!\n\n",

"Aang:Stop this! You have to let her go.\n\nGeneral Fong:(maliciously)You could save her if you were in the Avatar state.\n\nAang:(desperately)I'm trying... I'm trying!\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, I'm sinking!\n\nGeneral Fong:I don't see glowing.\n\nKatara:(terrified)Aaahhh! Please!\n\nAang:(hysterical)You don't need to do this!\n\n",

"Iroh:Zuko! Let's go!\n\nAzula:You know Father blames Uncle for the loss at the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar.(o.c.)Why would he want you back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him?\n\n",

"Roku:It's time you learned.\n\nRoku:The Avatar state is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars.\n\n",

"Roku:The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their energy through your body.\n\nRoku:In the avatar state you are at your most powerful, but you are also at your most vulnerable.\n\n",

"Aang:What do you mean?\n\nRoku:If you are killed in the Avatar state, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the Avatar will cease to exist.\n\n",

"General Fong:Hah! Are you joking? That was almost perfect! We just have to find a way to control you when you're like that.\n\nAang:You're out of your mind.\n\n",

"Soldier:Do you still want an escort to Omashu?\n\nKatara:I think we're all set.\n\n",

"Azula:Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the Fire Lord.\n\nAzula:(menacingly)There will be no place left to hide.\n\n",

"Sokka: We've got a lot of ground to cover if we wanna make it to Omashu today.\n\nKatara:(teasingly)What, like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?\n\n",

"Aang:So, you were showing me the octopus form.\n\nKatara:Right. Let me see your stance. Your arms are too far apart. See, if you move them closer together you protect your center. You got it?\n\nAang:(blushing, slightly flustered)Oh... yeah. Thanks.\n\n",

"Katara:Okay, let's see what you got.\n\nKatara:You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.\n\n",

"Chong:(singing)Don't fall in love with a traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and broken hearted...\n\nChong:(smiling and pointing briefly at them)Heh-hey! River people!\n\n",

"Katara: We're not river people.\n\nChong:You're not? Well then what kind of people are ya?\n\nAang:Just... people.\n\nChong:(pleased)Aren't we all, brother? Whoo.\n\n",

"Sokka:(with an accusing finger pointed at Chong)Who're you?\n\nChong:I'm Chong, and this is my wife Lily. We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind takes us!\n\n",

"Aang:You guys are nomads That's great! I'm a nomad.\n\nChong:Hey, me too.\n\nAang:(flatly)I know... you just said that.\n\n",

"Chong:Oh.(His attention wanders elsewhere, then to Sokka)Niceunderwear.\n\n",

"Zuko:(frustrated)I didn't find anything to eat. I can't live like this. I wasn't meant to be a fugitive.(kicks at the ground angrily)This is impossible!\n\n",

"Zuko:(more calmly)Uncle... what are you doing?\n\nIroh:You're looking at the rare white dragon bush.(lovingly)Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's heartbreaking!(gravely)That, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous.\n\n",

"Zuko:We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing.\n\nIroh:(still contemplating and stroking his chin)Delectable tea? Or deadly poison?\n\n",

"Aang:Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere.\n\nChong:(stops playing)Well, not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been we've heard about through stories and songs.\n\n",

"Aang:They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler.\n\nMoku:(dreamily)On the way there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow.\n\n",

"Sokka:(firmly)Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy I guess it's up to me. We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows.\n\nChong:Whoa... sounds like someone's got a case of \"destination fever,\" heh.",

"Lily:You've gotta focus less on the \"where\" and more on the \"going.\"\n\nSokka:(emphatically) O. Ma. Shu.\n\nKatara:Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.\n\n",

"Chong:Well, sounds like you're headed to Omashu.(Sokka smacks his forehead loudly at this.) There's an old story about a secret pass...(ominously)...right through the mountains.\n\nKatara:(skeptically)Is this real or a legend?\n\n",

"Sokka:I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.\n\nAang:Yeah. Thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground and we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable.\n\n",

"Iroh:Zuko, remember that plant that I thought might be tea?\n\nZuko:(horrified)You didn't!\n\nIroh:I did. (Iroh turns around to reveal his red, swollen face which he is scratching) And it wasn't.\n\nZuko:(in repulsion) Yah!\n\n",

"Iroh:(calmly while scratching) When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.(excitedly)But look what I found! These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant. That, or macahoni berries that cause blindness.\n\n",

"Zuko:(losing his patience)We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help.\n\nIroh:But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom, and fugitives from the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Zuko:(musingly)If the Earth Kingdom, discovers us, they'll have us killed.\n\nIroh:But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.\n\nZuko:Earth Kingdom it is.\n\n",

"Sokka:How far are we from the tunnel.\n\nChong:Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth.\n\n",

"Sokka:Labyrinth !\n\nChong:I'm sure we'll figure it out.\n\nLily:All you need to do is trust in love. According to the curse.\n\nSokka:(in exasperation)Curse!\n\n",

"Chong:Hey-hey, we're here!\n\nSokka:What exactly is this curse?\n\nChong:The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise you'll be trapped in them forever.\n\nLily:And die.\n\n",

"Chong:Oh, yeah, and die. Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song.(strums a chord on his guitar and sings low and dramatically)And die!\n\nSokka:(aggravated)That's it! There's no way we're going througbrh some cursed hole!\n\n",

"Moku:(cheerfully and pointing at the column of smoke)Hey, someone's making a big campfire!\n\nKatara:That's no campfire, Moku.\n\nSokka:That's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.\n\n",

"Aang:So all you need is to trust in love to get through these caves?\n\nChong:That is correct, Master Arrowhead.\n\nAang:We can make it.\n\nSokka:Everyone into the hole!\n\n",

"Katara:(sympathetically) It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. (less confidently) I hope.\n\nSokka:We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?\n\nChong:Eh, about two hours each.\n\n",

"Sokka:(while grabbing and stomping out the torches she lit)It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!\n\nLily:(spacey)Ohh, right.\n\n",

"Zuko:(standing and talking quickly)Yes, we're travelers.\n\nSong:Do you have names?\n\nZuko: Names Of course we have names. I'm... Lee. And this is my uncle, uh... Mushi.\n\nIroh: Yes, but my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior.\n\n",

"Zuko:Sorry, but we need to be moving on.\n\nSong:That's too bad. My mom always makes too much roast duck.\n\nIroh:Where do you live, exactly?\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.\n\nSokka:This doesn't make any sense; we already came through this way.\n\nChong:We don't need a map. We just need love. The little guy knows it.\n\nAang:Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map, also.\n\n",

"Zuko:I haven't seen my father in many years.\n\nSong:Oh. Is he fighting in the war?\n\nZuko:Yeah.\n\n",

"Chong:(worried)The tunnels... they're a-changin'. Ah, it must be the curse. I knew we shouldn't have come down here.\n\nSokka:(cynically)Right. If only we listened to you.\n\n",

"Chong:(calmly)Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us, heh heh.\n\nSokka:Noooooooo!\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, look!\n\nAang:We found the exit!\n\nKatara:This isn't the exit.\n\nAang:No... it's a tomb.\n\nAang:It must be the two lovers from the legend. That's who's buried here.\n\n",

"Katara:(voice-over)They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages.\n\n",

"Katara:(voice-over)The villages were enemies so they could not be together.\n\n",

"Katara:(voice-over)But their love was strong and they found a way.\n\nKatara:(voice-over)The two lovers learned earthbending from the badger moles. They became the first earthbenders.\n\n",

"Katara:(voice-over)They built elaborate tunnels so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be lost forever in the labyrinth.\n\n",

"Katara:(voice-over)Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power. She could have destroyed them all.\n\nKatara:(voice-over)But instead she declared the war over.\n\n",

"Katara:(reading the inscription) Love is brightest in the dark.\n\n",

"Sokka:(explodes)Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!\n\nChong:Well, then listen to this: if love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song.\n\n",

"Aang:How are we gonna find our way out of these tunnels?\n\nKatara:I have a crazy idea.\n\nAang:What?\n\nKatara:(hesitantly)Never mind, it's too crazy.\n\n",

"Aang:Katara, what is it?\n\nKatara:I was thinking... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love.\n\nAang:Right...\n\n",

"Aang:(totally clueless)Where are you going with this?\n\nKatara:(shyly)Well... what if we kissed?\n\nAang:(surprised)Us, kissing?\n\nKatara:See? It was a crazy idea.\n\nAang:(dreamily)Us... kissing...\n\n",

"Katara:(tries to laugh it off)Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that?\n\nAang:(also tries to laugh it off)Yeah, heh, heh.(He points at her for additional emphasis)I definitely wouldn't wanna kiss you!\n\n",

"Katara:(offended)Oh, well I didn't realize it was such a horrible option.(Leaning over at him in anger)Sorry I suggested it!\n\nAang:(trying desperately to recover)No, no, I mean... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying...\n\n",

"Katara:(turning to Aang, infuriated)Well, I'm not sure which I would rather do!\n\nAang:(dejected)What is wrong with me?\n\n",

"Chong:(singing)Even if you're lost you can't lose the love because it's in your heart, ooooohhhhh...\n\n",

"Iroh:(graciously)Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.\n\nSong's Mother:You're welcome. It brings me joy to see someone eat my cooking with such... gusto.\n\nIroh: Much practice. Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.\n\n",

"Zuko:(quietly, without much feeling)Thank you.\n\nSong:(quickly)I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned!\n\nZuko:(quietly, but intensely)I know.\n\n",

"Iroh:(appalled)What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.\n\nZuko:They're about to show us a little more kindness.(offers his hand to Iroh)Well?\n\n",

"Aang:(gloomily)We're gonna run out of light any second now, aren't we?\n\nKatara:I think so.\n\nAang:Then what are we gonna do?\n\nKatara:What can we do?\n\n",

"Chong:(happily)Hey-hey, you saved us, Sokka!\n\nSokka:No, they were trying to get away from something.\n\nChong:From what?\n\nChong:Hey, those things are music lovers!\n\n",

"Aang:It's made of some kind of crystals. They must only light up in the dark!\n\nKatara:That's how the two lovers found each other. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals.\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka!\n\nSokka:How did you guys get out?\n\nAang:Just like the legend says: we let love lead the way.\n\nSokka:Really? We let huge ferocious beasts lead our way.\n\n",

"Chong:(dead serious) Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you. I think that kid might be the Avatar.\n\nAang:So, are you guys gonna come to Omashu with us?\n\n",

"Chong:Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey.\n\nSokka:(sullenly, but also blushing)Just play your songs.\n\nChong:Hey, good plan!\n\n",

"Aang:I can't believe it. I know the war has spread far,(he turns to face his friends)but Omashu always seemed...untouchable.\n\nSokka:Up until now, it was. Now Ba-Sing-Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.\n\n",

"Katara:This is horrible, but we have to move on.\n\nAang:(firmly)No. I'm going in to find Bumi.\n\nSokka:Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still...\n\n",

"Aang:(defiantly)What? If he's still what?\n\nSokka:(refusing to meet Aang's eyes)...around.\n\nKatara:I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people around who can teach you earthbending.\n\n",

"Sokka:(from o.c.)A secret passage?\n\nSokka:Why didn't we just use this last time?(The cap pops off, releasing a huge gout of greenish sewage, some of which washes over Sokka.)Ugh!\n\nAang:Does that answer your question?\n\nSokka:Ew!\n\n",

"Guard:(from o.c.)Wait! What's the matter with him?\n\nKatara:Uh...he has pentapox, sir.\n\nKatara:(a pleasing, earnest look in her eyes)Um...it's highly contagious!\n\nSokka:Uuuuuu....It's so awful...I'm dyiiiing...\n\n",

"Katara:...and deadly...\n\nGuard:Wait, I think I've heard of pentapox.(to one of his comrades)Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?\n\nGuard:We'd better go wash our hands...and burn our clothes!\n\nAang:Thank you, sewer friend!\n\n",

"Crone Teacher: May no longer be wise...if you hope to keep the element of surprise.\n\nAzula:You're right. The royal procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile....nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends.\n\n",

"Katara:Let's find Bumi and get out of here.\n\nSokka:Where would they be keeping him?\n\nAang:Somewhere he can't earthbend.(looking up and around, cut to Aang's p.o.v. as he pans around)Somewhere made of metal.\n\n",

"Mai:There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.\n\nGovernor's Wife:Mai, your father was appointed governor. We're like royalty here. Be happy, and enjoy it.\n\n",

"Mai:(distressed, but in a dull tone)I thought my life was boring in the Fire Nation. But this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens.\n\nGovernor's Wife:(pointing at Aang)The resistance!\n\n",

"Azula:Ty Lee, could that possibly be you?\n\nTy Lee:Azula!\n\nTy Lee:It is so good to see you!\n\nAzula:(smiling)Please, don't let me interrupt your...(raises an eyebrow, searching for the right word and failing)whatever it is you were doing.\n\n",

"Azula:Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in... places like this.\n\n",

"Azula:I have a proposition for you. I'm hunting a traitor.(Looking at her wrist a bit absent mindedly)You remember my old fuddy duddy uncle, don't you?\n\nTy Lee: Oh yeah. He was so funny.\n\n",

"Azula:I would be honored if you would join me on my mission.\n\nTy Lee:Oh...I...uh...would love to.(Springs back to her feet in a single, fluid motion)But the truth is, I'm really happy here.(Smiling serenely)I mean, my aura has never been pinker!\n\n",

"Azula:I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me.\n\nTy Lee:(bowing slightly and clasping her hands in a gesture of thanks)Thank you, Azula.\n\n",

"Azula:Of course, before I leave, I'm going to catch your show.\n\nTy Lee: Uh... yeah... sure... uh... of course...\n\n",

"Aang:So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?\n\nResistance Leader:(With quiet intensity)Of course not! The day of the invasion, King Bumi surrendered.\n\n",

"Resistance Leader:The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he wanted to do.\n\nResistance Leader:He looked me in the eye and said...\n\nKing Bumi: I'm going to do...(he turns to face the camera) nothing!\n\n",

"Sokka:You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.\n\nSokka:The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta ACT sick, too. Ya gotta sell it!\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us.\n\nAang:(turning to face her)No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.\n\nAang:Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later.\n\n",

"Soldier:Plague! Plague!\n\nGovernor:What is going on down there?\n\nGuard:I saw some kids yesterday who were sick with pentapox. It must have spread!\n\n",

"Governor: Pentapox! I'm pretty sure I've heard of that.\n\nGovernor's Wife:Oh, this is terrible.\n\nGuard:What should we do?\n\nGovernor:Drive them out of the city...but don't touch them! We have to rid the city of this disease!\n\n",

"Aang:(climbing on top of Flopsie)Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh...I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!\n\n",

"Azula:Incredible. Do you think she'll fall?\n\nCircus Master:Of course not.\n\nAzula:Then wouldn't it make it more interesting if you removed the net?\n\nCircus Master:(concerned)Uh...the thing is...the performers...\n\n",

"Azula:You're right, you're right. That's been done.(After a short pause)I know. Set the net on fire.\n\nCircus Master:Of course, Princess.\n\n",

"Azula:Brilliant, just brilliant!(She looks back down at the Circus Master)Oooo, what kind of dangerous animals do you have?\n\nCircus Master:Well, our circus boasts the most exotic assortment...\n\nAzula:(cutting him off)Release them all!\n\n",

"Aang:(sadly)We looked everywhere. No Bumi.\n\nResistance Leader:We've got a problem. We just did a head count.\n\nKatara:Oh no. Did someone get left behind?\n\nResistance Leader:No,(pointing o.c. to the right)we have an extra.\n\n",

"Governor:So, the resistance has kidnapped my son.(exasperated)Everything so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi.\n\nGuard:(from behind)What do you want to do, sir?\n\n",

"Ty Lee:I'm sorry Azula, but unfortunately there won't be a show tomorrow.\n\nAzula:Really?\n\nTy Lee:(hanging up her tiara)The universe has given me strong hints that it's time for a career change. I want to join you on your mission.\n\n",

"Sokka:No! Bad Fire Nation baby!\n\nSokka:Oh...alright.\n\nKatara:(leaning over to hug the baby from behind)Ooo, you're so CUTE. Mmmmm...\n\n",

"Resistance Leader:Sure he's cute now, but when he's older, he'll join the Fire Nation army. You won't think he's so cute then. He'll be a killer.\n\nKatara: Does that look like the face of a killer to you?\n\n",

"Aang:It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. So...he wants to make a trade. His son(the camera rotates around Aang for additional effect)for King Bumi.\n\nSokka:You realize we're probably walking right into a trap?\n\n",

"Mai: (bowing, speaking in a dull voice) Please tell me you're here to kill me.\n\n Azula: (hugging Mai) It's great to see you, Mai.\n\n",

"Mai:(somewhat surprised)I thought you ran off and joined the circus? You said it was your calling.\n\nTy Lee:(releasing Mai and smiling widely)Well, Azula called a little louder.\n\n",

"Azula:I have a mission(she puts one of her hands on each of their shoulders)and I need you both.\n\nMai:Count me in. Anything to get me out of this place.\n\n",

"Azula:You stay here.(Mai and Ty Lee stand up behind her)Mai will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up. And there is no more \"Omashu\". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the City of New Ozai.\n\n",

"King Bumi:Hi, everybody!\n\nMai:You brought my brother?\n\nAang:He's here. We're ready to trade.\n\nAzula:(to Mai, Bumi grinning behind them all) I'm sorry, but a thought just occurred to me. Do you mind?\n\nMai:(turning to Azula)Of course not, Princess Azula.\n\n",

"Azula:We're trading a two year old for a king.(She turns to Bumi)A powerful, earthbending king.\n\nKing Bumi: Mmm hmmm!\n\nAzula:(turning back to Mai)It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it?\n\nMai:You're right.(To Aang)The deal's off.\n\n",

"King Bumi:(enjoying himself)Whhhoa! See you all later!\n\nAang:Bumi!\n\n",

"King Bumi:Aang, is that you? Where did you come from?\n\nAang:Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here.\n\n",

"Aang:(smiling and laughing)Just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?\n\nKing Bumi:Aang, I need to talk to you!\n\nAang:(not understanding because of the noise)It's good to see you too!\n\n",

"Mai:(taunting)How are you gonna fight without your bending?\n\nSokka:I seem to manage!\n\nKatara:There's Aang!\n\nSokka:We can catch him!\n\n",

"Aang:Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!\n\nAang:You could earthbend all along!?\n\nKing Bumi:Well, they didn't cover my face.\n\n",

"Aang:I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi!?\n\nKing Bumi:Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jin. It's a choice of how you direct your energy.\n\n",

"Aang:I know! There's positive jin when you're attacking, and negative jin when you're retreating.\n\nKing Bumi:And neutral jin(the camera zooms to a close up of Bumi's face)when you do nothing!\n\n",

"Aang: There are three jins?\n\nKing Bumi:Well, technically there are eighty five. But, let's just focus on the third. Neutral jin is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\n",

"Aang:(with dawning understanding)That's why you surrendered, isn't it?\n\nKing Bumi:Yes, and it's why I can't leave now.\n\nAang:I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.\n\n",

"King Bumi:Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jin. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking.\n\n",

"Aang: Hey, Momo!\n\nKing Bumi: Momo's mastered a few jins himself!\n\nKing Bumi: Goodbye, Aang. I'll see you when the time is right.\n\n",

"Mai:So, we're tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh?\n\nTy Lee: (teasing) It'll be interesting seeing Zuko again, won't it, Mai?\n\nAzula:It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. We have a third target now.\n\n",

"Iroh: Spare coins for weary travelers?\n\nZuko: This is humiliating! We're royalty. These people should be giving us whatever we want.\n\nIroh: They will - if you ask nicely.\n\n",

"Iroh: (in a weak voice)Spare change for a hungry old man?\n\nYoung Woman: Aww,(she produces a coin from her sleeve and puts it in his hat)here you go.\n\n",

"Broadsword Man: Hahaha! Nothing like a fat man dancing for his dinner.(Tosses coin)Here ya go!\n\nIroh:(smiling)Such a kind man!\n\n",

"Sokka: Aang! Why are we going down?\n\nAang: What?(Wiping his forehead with his left hand)I didn't even notice.\n\nSokka: Are you noticing now?\n\n",

"Katara:(coming up from behind)Is something wrong?\n\nAang: I know this is gonna sound weird, but... I think the swamp is... calling to me.\n\n",

"Sokka: It is telling ya where we can get something to eat?\n\nAang: No, I... I think it wants us to land there.\n\nSokka: No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.\n\n",

"Aang: I don't know... Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?\n\nSokka: Yes!\n\n",

"Katara: I don't know... There's something ominous about that place.\n\nSokka: See Even Appa and Momo don't like it here.\n\n",

"Aang: Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this... bye swamp.\n\nAang: Yip! Yip!\n\n",

"Aang: Where's Appa and Momo?\n\nAang:(calling fruitlessly)Appa! Momo!\n\nKatara: Sokka! You've got an elbow leech!\n\nSokka:(freaking out)Where! Where!\n\nKatara: Where do you think?\n\n",

"Katara: You couldn't find them?\n\nAang: No... and the tornado... it just disappeared.\n\nSokka: We better speed things up!\n\nAang:(concerned)Maybe... we should be a little nicer to the swamp.\n\n",

"Sokka: Aang, these are just plants! Do you want me to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" as I swing my machete back and forth?\n\nKatara: Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels... alive.\n\n",

"Katara:(calling out)Appa! Momo!\n\nSokka: There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night.\n\n",

"Katara: What was that!\n\nSokka: Nothing. Just swamp gas.(The gas begins to swirl about them)Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.\n\n",

"Sokka: I think we should build a fire...\n\nAang: Sokka, the longer we're here the more I think you shouldn't be doing that.\n\n",

"Sokka:(slightly sarcastically)No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine.(He turns to address a nearby root)Right, swamp?(he grabs the root and begins to shake as he fakes a reply in a funny voice)\"No problem, Sokka!\"\n\n",

"Katara: Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?\n\nSokka: Please, we're all alone out here.\n\nAang: ...except for them.\n\nSokka:(terrified)Right, except for them.\n\n",

"Due: Leaves a nice, wide trail to folla'.\n\nTho: You know what's at the end of that trail?\n\nTho: Dinner.\n\n",

"Katara:(calling out)Aang?(Cut to a closer shot)Sokka?\n\nKatara: Hello? Hello? Can you help me? (She squints, then cut to again to water tribe woman's back) Mom? (More loudly and running towards the figure) Mom!\n\n",

"Sokka: Hello? Yue? This is just a trick of the light... swamp gas... I... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy.\n\nPrincess Yue:(her voice sounds as if from far away, echoing)You didn't protect me.\n\n",

"Aang: Hello?\n\nAang:(from o.c.)Who are you?\n\nAang: Hey, come back!\n\n",

"Tho: Naw, that's what they call a \"lemoo,\" saw one at a travelin' show once. Real smart they say.\n\nDue: Bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken.\n\nTho: You think everything tastes like possum chicken.\n\n",

"Sokka: What do you guys think you're doing! I've been looking all over for you!\n\nKatara:(displeased with Sokka's attitude)Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!\n\nAang:(airbending himself to his feet)I was chasing some girl.\n\n",

"Katara: What girl?\n\nAang:(helping Katara to her feet)I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.\n\nSokka:(sarcastically)Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!\n\n",

"Katara:(after a pause and looking down)I thought I saw Mom.\n\nSokka: Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.\n\n",

"Katara: You saw something too?\n\nSokka:(turning away)I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything.(Turning back to the others)Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.\n\n",

"Aang: What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.\n\nKatara: Okay... so where's here?(Gesturing in front of them)The middle of the swamp?\n\n",

"Sokka:(spitting and startled)What are you doing in my mouth!\n\nSokka: Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.\n\n",

"Sokka: Wait, my boomerang!\n\nKatara: There's no time!\n\nSokka: Oh, I see. There's time to get yours crolls and time to get your stuff, but no time for my boomerang?\n\nKatara:(cheerfully)That's correct!\n\nSokka:(resigned) Oh.\n\n",

"Aang:(initially from o.c.) Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.\n\nSokka: I feel like I've lost part of my identity. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or if Katara lost her...(cut to Katara, looking confused)... hair loopies.\n\n",

"Merchant: Here's your produce, ponytail guy.\n\nSokka:(picks up basket, then, dejected)I used to be boomerang guy...\n\n",

"Merchant: So long as it's money.(closes shop and begins to walk away)Have a nice Avatar Day!\n\nAang: Avatar Day?\n\nMerchant:(turning around)You guys are going to the festival, right?\n\n",

"Aang: There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?\n\nKatara: Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float.\n\nSokka: And here comes Avatar Roku.\n\n",

"Aang: Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.\n\nSokka: And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food.\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, look!\n\nAang:(smiling)That's the biggest me I've ever seen.\n\n",

"Katara: Hey, what's that guy doing?\n\nTorch Man: Yaaaah!\n\nCrowd:(chanting in unison)Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!\n\n",

"Iroh: Where did you get these?\n\nZuko:(walking away)What does it matter where they came from?\n\nIroh:(seriously)Hmm...(eats food and smiles as pink goo drips from his mouth)Mmmm!\n\n",

"Crowd:(chanting in unison)Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!\n\nSpectator 1:(angrily)Hey! That party-pooper's ruining Avatar Day!\n\n",

"Aang: That party-pooper's my friend!\n\nMayor Tong:(surprised)It's the Avatar himself!\n\nSpectator 1:(panicking)It's going to kill us with its awesome Avatar powers!\n\nAang: No, I'm not, I...\n\n",

"Majoy Tong:(snootily)I suggest you leave. You're not welcome here, Avatar.\n\nKatara: Why not? Aang helps people.\n\nAang: It's true.(airbending himself down to where Katara and the Mayor stand)I'm on your side.\n\n",

"Mayor Tong:(accusingly)I find that hard to swallow considering what you did to us in your past life. It was Avatar Kyoshi; she murdered our glorious leader, Chin the Great.\n\nAang: You think that I... murdered someone...\n\n",

"Aang:(to everyone)Give me a chance to clear my name.\n\nMayor Tong: The only way to prove your innocence is to stand trial.\n\nAang:(confidently)I'll gladly stand trial.\n\n",

"Sokka: So some people don't like you. Big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here.\n\nAang: I can't.\n\nSokka:(upbeat)Sure you can! A little... swish, swish, swish! Airbending slice! ... and we're on our way.\n\n",

"Aang: I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer, either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.\n\nSokka: How're we gonna do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.\n\n",

"Aang:(shrewdly)That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective.\n\nSokka:(self-importantly)Well, I guess I could be classified as such.\n\n",

"Sokka:(bragging)Everyone wanted to blame it on a polar leopard, but I figured out that it was Old Man Jarco wearing polar leopard boots. See, a real eight hundred pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. Okay, I guess I am pretty good.\n\n",

"Aang: So you'll help me with my case?\n\nSokka: Fine. But I'm gonna need some new props.\n\n",

"Katara:(getting worked up)So if they were built at the same time, that means...\n\nSokka:(interrupting)Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple.\n\n",

"Koko:(stomps her foot, annoyed)Where's Aangy?\n\nKatara: He couldn't be here, Koko.\n\nCrowd:(disappointed)Ohhh...\n\nKoko: I wanted to see Aangy...\n\n",

"Sokka:(looking ridiculous with his hat and pipe)They say it was Kyoshi.\n\nOyagi: Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name.\n\n",

"Sokka: So, uh... what's Suki up to? Is she around?\n\nOyagi: Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world.\n\nSokka:(sadly)Oh, well... that's great.",

"Oyagi: The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.\n\nKatara:(touching the kimono)She had exquisite taste.\n\nOyagi:(quickly)Please don't touch.\n\n",

"Katara: These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!\n\nOyagi:(full of pride)The biggest of any Avatar.\n\n",

"Katara:(with realization)Wait a minute... big feet? Little footprints? There's no way!\n\nSokka: Ahem.(Sokka clears his throat, interrupting her)Special outfit Hat and pipe These things mean anything to you?\n\n",

"Katara:(with mock respect)You're right. I'm sorry. Please.\n\nSokka:(dramatically)Aha! There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint and therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene!\n\n",

"Prisoner 1: Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny, not to mention you're the Avatar.\n\nAang:(smiling)You guys are great.\n\nPrisoner 3: Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel. \n\n",

"Sokka: This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise; it took place at sunset. Look at the shadows.\n\nKatara: They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.\n\nOyagi: So what?\n\n",

"Mayor Tong: Evidence? Hmph! That's not how our court system works.\n\nAang: Then how can I prove my innocence?\n\nMayor Tong: Simple. I say what happened and then you say what happened and then I decide who's right.\n\n",

"Sokka:(quietly)You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence.\n\nAang: Right... evidence. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one...(Aang blanks)Uh...\n\n",

"Zuko:(avoids the question)Do you like your new teapot?\n\nIroh: To be honest with you, the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.",

"Iroh: I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.\n\nZuko: There's no honor for me without the Avatar.\n\n",

"Iroh: Zuko...(sighs)Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.\n\nZuko:(abruptly)Then there is no hope at all.\n\n",

"Iroh: (quickly) No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.\n\n",

"Avatar Kyoshi: I killed Chin the Conqueror.\n\nAvatar Kyoshi:(voice over)A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding his army to all corners of the continent.\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle, I thought a lot about what you said.\n\nIroh:(pleased)You did? Good, good.\n\nZuko: It's helped me realize something. We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together. I need to find my own way.\n\nIroh: Wait!\n\n",

"Spectator 1:(rooting)Come on, torture machine!\n\nOld Man: Eaten by bears!\n\nSpectator 2: Razor pit!\n\nKatara:(worried)Community service! Please stop on community service.\n\nBailiff: Looks like it's \"boiled in oil.\"\n\n",

"Mayor Tong:(cowers)You! Avatar! Do something!\n\nAang:(calmly)Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.\n\nMayor Tong:(spins the wheel to the community service wedge and stops it there) There! \"Community service.\" Now serve our community!\n\n",

"Aang: Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament exactly?\n\nStudent 1: It's on the Island of Noneoya - none o' ya business\n\nSokka: Ha, ha! Oh, I got to remember that one.\n\nKatara: (in a comforting tone) I'll take care of this.",

"Xin Fu: Next, The Boulder versus Fire Nation Man!\n\nSokka: (giving thumbs down) Boo! Boo!\n\nFire Nation Man: Please to rise for Fire Nation national anthem. (singing) Fire Lord, my flame (drops to his knees) burns for thee\n\nSokka: Go back to the Fire Nation!",

"Xin Fu: Now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The Boulder versus your champion...\n\nXin Fu: The Blind Bandit!\n\nKatara: She can't really be blind. It's just part of her character, right?\n\nAang: I think she is.\n\nSokka: I think she is... (yells)going down!",

"Boulder: The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a blind girl.\n\nToph: Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder.\n\nBoulder: The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings, and now he's ready to bury you in a rock-a-lanche!\n\nToph: Whenever you're ready.. Ha ha ha!",

"Sokka: Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!\n\nToph: Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here?\n\nAang: I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.\n\nSokka: Boo! No talking!\n\nKatara: (smacking her brother) Don't boo at him!",

"Toph: Somebody's a little light on his feet. What's your fighting name, The Fancy Dancer?\n\nToph: Where'd you go?\n\nAang: Please, wait!\n\nToph: There you are!",

"Aang: Please listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you.\n\nToph: Whoever you are, just leave me alone.",

"Student 2: Hey, (walking towards Aang) you're the kid who beat The Blind Bandit.\n\nAang: We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives\n\nStudent 1: The Blind Bandit's a mystery. She shows up to fight, then disappears.",

"Toph: What are you doing here, twinkle toes?\n\nAang: How did you know it was me?\n\nSokka: Don't answer to twinkle toes. It's not manly\n\nKatara: You're the one whose bag matches his belt.\n\nToph: How did you find me?",

"Katara: What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar, and if he doesn't master earthbending soon he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.\n\nToph: Not my problem. Now get out of here or I'll call the guards.",

"Toph: What's your problem?\n\nAang: What's your problem?",

"Toph: Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing.\n\nToph: I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I can feel the vibrations in the earth, and I can see where everything is. You, that tree, even those ants.",

"Aang: That's amazing.\n\nToph: (frustrated) My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.\n\nAang: Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?\n\nToph: Yeah.",

"Aang: Then why stay here where you're not happy?\n\nToph: They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go?\n\nAang: You could come with us.\n\nToph: Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want. No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life.",

"Toph: You think you're so tough...\n\nToph: ...why don't you come up here so I can smack that grin off your face?",

"Lao: My daughter is blind. She is blind and tiny and helpless and fragile. She cannot help you\n\nToph: Yes, I can\n\nToph: Let him go. I beat you all before, and I'll do it again.",

"Toph: Dad, I know it's hard for you to see me this way, but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender. And I'm really, really good at it.",

"Aang: Toph! What are you doing here?\n\nToph: My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world.\n\nSokka: Well, we'd better get out of here - before your dad changes his mind again.\n\nToph: Good idea.\n\nAang: You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.",

"Zuko: Could I get some water, a bag of feed, and something hot to eat?\n\nMerchant: Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you two bags of feed.\n\n",

"Gow: Hey! You throwing eggs at us, stranger?\n\nZuko: No.\n\nGow: You see who did throw it?\n\nZuko:(turning around and putting his hand on his sword hilt)No.\n\n",

"Gow: Egg had to come from somewhere.\n\nZuko:(turning back to the merchant)Maybe a chicken flew over.\n\n",

"Lee: This guy just stood up to the soldiers! By the end, he practically had them running away.\n\nSela:(in a friendly manner) Does this guy have a name?\n\nZuko: I'm, uh...\n\n",

"Zuko: I can't. I should be moving on.\n\nSela: Gansu could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat.\n\n",

"Lee: You don't seem like you're from around here.\n\nZuko: Uh-uh.\n\nLee: Where are you from then?\n\nZuko: Far away.\n\nLee: Oh. Where're you going?\n\nGansu: Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it?\n\n",

"Zuko: Stupid turtle duck, why'd she do that?\n\nUrsa: Zuko, that's what moms are like. If you mess with their babies, they'll bite you back.\n\n",

"Azula:(whispers to Ty Lee)Watch this.\n\nAzula: Mom, can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game.\n\n",

"Zuko:(emphatically)I am not cart wheeling.\n\nAzula: You won't have to. Cart wheeling's not a game,(under her breath)dumb dumb.\n\nZuko: I don't care. I don't want to play with you.\n\n",

"Azula: We are brother and sister.(her voice becoming sickly sweet)It's important for us to spend time together. Don't you think so, mom?\n\nUrsa: Yes darling,(to Zuko)I think it's a good idea to play with your sister. Go on now, just for a little while.\n\n",

"Azula:(voice over)Here's the way it goes.\n\nAzula: Now what you do is try to knock the apple off the other person's head. Like this.\n\nTy Lee: Aw, they're so cute together.\n\nMai:(getting up as Zuko walks off)You two are such... ugh!\n\n",

"Zuko:(reading the inscription) \"Never give up without a fight.\"\n\n",

"Azula: If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, then dad would be next in line to be Fire Lord, wouldn't he?\n\nUrsa:(disappointed)Azula, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return. And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health.\n\n",

"Zuko: How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die?\n\nAzula: I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than(looking at the doll with disdain)his royal tea loving kookiness.\n\n",

"Zuko: Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Don't think of them as separate, because they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole.\n\nLee: I think you'd really like my brother Sen Su. He used to show me stuff like this all the time.\n\n",

"Zuko: No. I need to move on. Here.(offers him his dagger)I want you to have this. Read the inscription.\n\nLee: \"Made in the Earth Kingdom.\"\n\nZuko: The other one.\n\nLee: \"Never give up without a fight.\"\n\n",

"Azula: You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good.\n\nZuko:(getting up, his cheeks flaming)Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am!\n\n",

"Azula:(getting up and walking over to him)By the way, Uncle's coming home.\n\nZuko: Does that mean we won the war?\n\nAzula: No. It mean's Uncle's a quitter and a loser.\n\nZuko: What are you talking about? Uncle's not a quitter.\n\n",

"Azula: He found out his son died and he just fell apart. A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying.\n\nZuko: How do you know what he should do? He's probably just sad his only kid is gone... forever.\n\n",

"Azula: Fire Lord Azulon. Can't you just call him  \"Grandfather\"? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up talking his place soon.\n\nUrsa: Young lady! Not, another, word. (Azula runs past)What is wrong with that child?\n\n",

"Azula: He cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes.\n\nOzai: Correct my dear. Now, won't you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me?\n\n",

"Ozai: She's a true prodigy. Just like her Grandfather for whom she's named.\n\nAzula:(whispering to Zuko)You'll never catch up.\n\n",

"Zuko:(dejected)I failed.\n\nUrsa: No, I loved watching you. That's who you are Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard.\n\n",

"Azulon: Say what it is you want.\n\nOzai: Father, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation.\n\nAzulon: You dare suggest I betray Iroh? Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think Iroh has suffered enough.\n\n",

"Azula: Dad's going to kill you.(normal voice)Really,(turning to look at him with a leer)he is.\n\nZuko:(sarcastically)Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try.\n\n",

"Zuko: Liar!\n\nAzula: I'm only telling you for your own good. I know, maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you.\n\n",

"Zuko: Stop it, you're lying!(holding his blanket for security)Dad would never do that to me.\n\nUrsa:(voice over)Your father would never do what to you?(cut to Ursa entering the room)What is going on here?\n\n",

"Azula:(innocently)I don't know.\n\nUrsa:(grabbing Azula)It's time for a talk.\n\n",

"Zuko:(almost chanting)Azula always lies... Azula always lies...\n\nZuko: Azula always lies...\n\n",

"Lee: Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come.\n\nZuko:(in a threatening tone)Let the kid go.\n\nGow: Who do you think you are? Telling us what to do?\n\n",

"Zuko: It doesn't matter who I am, but I know who you are. You're not soldiers. You're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power.\n\n",

"Ursa: Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done,(she hugs him)I've done to protect you. Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.\n\n",

"Gow:(weakly)Who, who are you?\n\nZuko:(with confidence)My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.(sheathing his swords)Prince of the Fire Nation and heir to the throne.\n\n",

"Zuko: Mom? Mom, mom!\n\nZuko:(slightly panicked)Where's mom?\n\nAzula: No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away.\n\nZuko: Not funny, Azula. You're sick. And I want my knife back, now.\n\n",

"Toph: Hey, you guys picked a great campsite. The grass is so soft.\n\nSokka: That's not grass. Appa's shedding.\n\n",

"Katara: I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group because you two are disgusting\n\nToph: Excuse me, does anyone have a razor..(She lifts both arms to reveal a mass of white fur emerging out of both of her sleeves).. because I've got some hairy pits!\n\n",

"Katara: So, Toph, usually when setting up camp we try to divide up the work.\n\nToph: Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go.\n\n",

"Toph:Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food, and look, my tent's all set up.\n\nKatara: that's great for you, but we still need to finish...\n\nToph: I don't understand. What's the problem here?\n\n",

"Katara: Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each others' nerves.\n\nToph: Yeah, you do seem pretty tired.\n\n",

"Katara:(angrily)I meant all of us.\n\nToph: Well, goodnight.\n\nKatara:(half-heartedly)Goodnight.\n\n",

"Toph: There's something coming toward us!\n\nAang: What is it?\n\nToph: It feels like an avalanche... But also not like an avalanche.\n\nSokka: Your powers of perception are frightening.\n\n",

"Katara: Should we leave?\n\nAang: Better safe than sorry.\n\nKatara: What is that thing?\n\n",

"Toph: Ahh, land, sweet land! See you guys in the morning!\n\nKatara: Actually, can you help us unload?\n\nToph: Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?\n\n",

"Katara: Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now and...\n\nToph:(Irritated)Look.(Pointing at Katara)I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff. I'm carrying my own weight.\n\n",

"Katara: That's not the point.\n\nKatara: Ever since joining us you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful.\n\nToph:What? Look here, sugar queen, I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending, so don't you talk to me about being selfish!\n\n",

"Katara:Sugar Queen! (D-Did you just slam the door in my face!\n\nKatara: How can you be so infuriating!\n\nAang:(Hesitant)Should we... do something?\n\nSokka: Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.\n\n",

"Toph: That thing is back!\n\nSokka: Well, how far away is it? Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.\n\nAang:(urgently in voice over)I don't think so, Sokka.\n\n",

"Katara: Seriously, what is that thing?\n\nToph: And how does it keep finding us?\n\nAang: I don't know, but this time I'm going to make sure we lose 'em.\n\n",

"Katara: That's good, because Toph wasn't going to help anyway.\n\nToph: Oh, I didn't realize baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed.\n\n",

"Katara: It could be Zuko. We haven't seen him since the North Pole.\n\nToph: Who's Zuko?\n\nSokka: Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.\n\n",

"Katara:(jokingly)What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail?\n\nSokka:(gesturing to his hair, speaking in a muffled voice)This is a warrior's wolf tail.\n\n",

"Aang: That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.\n\nToph: I can feel it with my own two feet!\n\n",

"Katara: Let's get out of here!\n\nAang: Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.\n\nSokka: Always the optimist.\n\n",

"Katara: It's those three girls from Omashu!\n\nToph: We can take 'em. Three on three.\n\n",

"Sokka: Actually, Toph, there's four of us.\n\nToph: Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all.\n\nSokka: I can still fight!\n\nToph: Okay. Three on three plus Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka: Well, we wanted to find out who they were. We found out. Now let's get out of here.\n\nAang: Appa, yip yip!\n\nKatara: I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.",

"Toph: I still think we could've taken them.\n\nKatara: Are you kidding? The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary.",

"Sokka: Oh no, the sun is rising! We've been up all night with no sleep.\n\nAang: Sokka, we'll be okay.\n\nSokka: Are you sure!? I've never not slept before! What if I fall asleep now and something happens? And something always happens!\n\n",

"Katara: Every time we land, those girls are there, so we'll just have to keep flying.\n\nAang: We can't keep flying forever.\n\nAang:(yawns)So, what's the plan?\n\nToph: Don't know... too tired to think.\n\n",

"Katara: I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.\n\nSokka: Yes! Sleep!\n\n",

"Toph(shouting): What's going on!\n\nAang: Appa fell asleep!\n\nAang: Wake up, buddy!\n\nAang: Appa's exhausted.\n\n",

"Sokka: Okay, we've put a lot of distance between us and them. The plan now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.\n\nKatara: Of course, we could have gotten some sleep earlier if Toph didn't have such issues.\n\nToph: What!?\n\n",

"Toph: You're blaming me for this!?\n\nAang: No, no! She's not blaming you!\n\nKatara: No, I'm blaming her!\n\nToph: Hey!\n\n",

"Toph: I never asked you for diddly doo da. I carry my own weight!\n\nToph: Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's sheddy over here!\n\n",

"Aang: What? You're blaming Appa?!\n\nToph: Yeah! You wanna know how they keep finding us?\n\n",

"Toph: I'm outta here.\n\nSokka: Wait.\n\nAang: What did I just do!?\n\nAang: I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.\n\n,"

"Katara: I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other, and I was so mean to her.\n\nSokka: Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.\n\nKatara:(Sarcastically)Thanks, Sokka.\n\nSokka: No problem.\n\n",

"Katara: We need to find Toph and apologize.\n\nSokka: Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?\n\n",

"Aang: I have a plan.\n\nAang: Toph was right. Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail!\n\n",

"Katara: Are you sure that he's okay to fly?\n\nAang: He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.(He moves to a pile of fur and places it into a bag)I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course.\n\n",

"Mai: Wads of wet fur. How delightful.\n\n,Ty Lee: Hmm... They're not wads, more like... bundles. Or bunches... It's got an \"uh\" sound.\n\nMai: Clumps?\n\nTy Lee:(Delighted) Clumps!(she jumps forward grabbing Mai around the neck in a hug.)They're clumps!",

"Mai: The trail goes this way.\n\nAzula: The Avatar is trying to give us the slip. You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.(Cut to shot of the fur trail again)I'll follow this trail.",

"Sokka: Toph couldn't have made it too far.(Momo begins screeching.)What is it, Momo... oh no! Katara!\n\nKatara: How did they find us?\n\nSokka: Appa, come on! We need to go faster!\n\nKatara: He's too tired!\n\n",

"Sokka: Not good, not good!\n\nSokka: We just need to make it across that river!\n\nKatara: Come on, Appa, just a little further!\n\nSokka:(voice over)We made it! We're safe!\n\n",

"Katara:(voice over)You did it, Appa!\n\nSokka: Good try, but no.\n\nSokka: How ya doing?\n\nKatara:(in a frenetic voice)Well, you know!\n\n",

"Mai: I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys (she slumps a bit and looks down in disappointment) it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring.",

"Sokka: Thanks Appa. I don't know what we'd do without you.\n\n",

"Ty Lee: (turning to Mai) Was it just me, or was that guy kinda cute?",

"Aang: Now who are you and what do you want?\n\nAzula: You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint.(Imitation of Zuko's voice)I must find the Avatar to restore my honor. It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny.\n\nAang: So what now?",

"Azula: Now... Now it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go. You can run, but I'll catch you.\n\nAang:(standing up)I'm not running.\n\n",

"Iroh: Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.\n\nToph:(she takes it)You seem a little too old.\n\nIroh:(laughs)Perhaps I am.\n\nToph: I know what you're thinking. I look like I can't handle being by myself.\n\n",

"Iroh: I wasn't thinking that.\n\nToph: You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea.\n\nIroh: I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.",

"Toph: They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself by myself.\n\nIroh: You sound like my nephew. Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting people who love you help you.", 

"Iroh: Not that I love you; I just met you.\n\nToph:(laughs)So, where is your nephew?\n\nIroh: I've been tracking him, actually.\n\nToph: Is he lost?\n\n",

"Iroh: Yes, a little bit. His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He is trying to figure out who he is and he went away.\n\nToph: So... now you're following him.\n\n",

"Iroh: I know he doesn't want me around right now, but, if he needs me, I'll be there.\n\nToph: Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.(standing up)Thank you.\n\n",

"Iroh: My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.\n\nToph: No, thank you for what you said. It helped me.\n\n",

"Iroh: I'm glad.\n\nToph: Oh, and about your nephew? Maybe you should tell him that you need him too.\n\n",

"Azula: Do you really want to fight me?\n\nZuko: Yes,(he stands and throws his straw coolie hat away)I really do.\n\n",

"Aang: Zuko!\n\nAzula: I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.\n\nAang:(laughs a bit)Zuzu?\n\nZuko: Back off, Azula! He's mine!\n\n",

"Azula: I'm not going anywhere.\n\nAang: Katara!\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle...\n\nIroh: Get up!\n\n",

"Toph: I thought you guys could use a little help.\n\nKatara:(with a genuine smile)Thanks.\n\n",

"Azula: Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors all working together. I'm done.(she raises her hands in a gesture of surrender)I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor.",

"Zuko: Get away from us!\n\nKatara: Zuko, I can help!\n\nZuko: Leave!\n\n",

"Aang: Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place... i-it's perfect! Don't you think, Sokka?\n\nAang: Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?\n\nAang:(whispering)Sorry!\n\n",

"Toph: Good morning, earthbending student!\n\nAang: Good morning, sifu Toph.\n\nKatara:(sleepily)Hey... you never call me sifu Katara.\n\nAang: Well, if you think I should...\n\n",

"Toph: Sorry, snoozles. We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.\n\nAang: So what move are you going to teach me first? Rockalanche? The trembler? Oh! Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land!\n\nToph: Let's start with \"move a rock\"",

"Toph: The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element.(She shoves Aang, causing him to stumble to the side.)If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.\n\nAang: Like a rock. Got it.\n\n",

"Toph: Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple. Okay, you ready to give it a try?\n\nAang: I'm ready.\n\nSokka: Rock beats airbender!",

"Lu Ten:(laughs) I got you, dad!\n\nIroh: My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.\n\nZuko: Uncle!\n\nZuko: You were unconscious. Azula did this to you.\n\nZuko: It was a surprise attack.\n\n",

"Iroh: Somehow, that's not so surprising.\n\nZuko: I hope I made it the way you like it.\n\nIroh: Mmm, good.(He takes another drink and grunts.)That was very, uhh... bracing!",

"Zuko: So uncle, It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.\n\n",

"Iroh: No, she's crazy and she needs to go down.(Zuko nods. Iroh grunts as he stands up.)It's time to resume your training.",

"Aang: Maybe there's another way. What if I came at the boulder from a different angle?\n\nToph: No, that's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickity trick that's going to move that rock.", 

"Toph: You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this!\n\nAang: Whoa!\n\n",

"Katara: I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.\n\n",

"Toph: Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.(Cut to Toph shouting.)Keep your knees high, twinkletoes!\n\nToph: Rocklike!\n\nToph: Rocklike!\n\n",

"Sokka: You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat. Just a bit closer...\n\nSokka: Gotcha! You are a lucky little meat creature.",

"Iroh: Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.",

"Zuko: I see. That's why we're drinking tea: To calm the mind.\n\nIroh: Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes.\n\n",

"Iroh: There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang; positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance.",

"Iroh: The energy wants to restore balance and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together. You provide release and guidance, creating lightning.\n\nZuko: I'm ready to try it!\n\n",

"Iroh: Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.",

"Toph: This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you.",

"Toph: If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock.(Cut to a close-up of Aang's face. His mouth opens and he looks surprised and scared. Katara looks on with concern in the background. Cut back to Toph.) Like this.\n\n",

"Katara: Sorry, Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending?\n\nToph: I'm glad you said something. Actually, there is a better way. (She jerks off Aang's belt and blindfolds him with it.)",

"Toph:This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara!\n\nAang:(sarcastically)Yeah, thanks Katara!\n\nKatara:(nervously)Heh.\n\n",

"Aang: I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.\n\nToph: There's nothing to say. You blew it. You had a perfect stance and perfect form but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts.\n\nAang: I know. I'm sorry.\n\n",

"Toph: Yeah, you are sorry. If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?!",

"Katara: Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay?\n\nAang: Yeah... that sounds good.\n\n",

"Toph: Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.\n\nZuko: Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning, it keeps exploding in my face! Like everything always does!\n\n",

"Iroh: I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.\n\nZuko:(frustrated and enraged)What turmoil?\n\n",

"Iroh: Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.\n\nZuko: But I don't feel any shame at all! I'm as proud as ever!\n\nIroh: Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.",

"Zuko: Well... my life has been nothing but humbling lately.\n\nIroh: I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself!",

"Sokka: You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things! Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way.\n\n",

"Sokka: I admit it. You're cute. Okay, you've convinced me. If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.\n\n",

"Katara: You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?\n\nAang:(dejectedly)I don't want to talk about it.\n\n",

"Katara: You do know that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it...\n\nAang:(frustrated)I know I know I know I know, I get it, alright! I need to face it head-on, like a rock. But I just can't do it!",

"Katara: Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?\n\nAang: I guess it's earth.\n\n",

"Katara: That's why it's so hard for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast!\n\nKatara: Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.\n\nAang: Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara.",

"Iroh: Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring",

"Iroh: Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!",

"Iroh: Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.\n\n",

"Zuko: Why are you telling me these things?\n\nIroh: It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.\n\n",

"Zuko: All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.\n\nIroh: It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. You see, the technique I am about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.\n\n",

"Toph: You know, I also have this great new nutcracker.\n\nAang: Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't. That's an antique, hand crafted by the monks! It's a delicate instrument!\n\nToph: It's not the only delicate instrument around here.",

"Aang: Ohmmmm...\n\nKatara: Hey Aang, have you seen...\n\nAang:(annoyed)Meditating here!\n\n",

"Katara: It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.\n\nAang: We'll find him faster if we split up.\n\n",

"Sokka: Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? OW! That's all I got! It's pretty much my whole identity! Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy!",

"Aang: Sokka! Are you okay?\n\nSokka:(grunts)Stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!\n\n",

"Aang:(scratching his head pensively)Hmm... I bet I can airbend you out of here.\n\nSokka: Seriously, Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?\n\n",

"Sokka:(annoyed)If you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.\n\nAang: I can't do that either.\n\nSokka: You can't? Why not?\n\nAang: It would just be really... uncomfortable.\n\n",

"Sokka: Awkward position... I think I know the feeling.\n\nAang: If I try, I fail. But if I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\n",

"Sokka: Hmm. How about that.(He motions to the mooselion.)Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.\n\nAang: Aww, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub.\n\n",

"Sokka: Really? He looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion.\n\nAang: It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. Whatcha doin' out here, little guy? Did you lose your mama?\n\n",

"Iroh: Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.\n\nZuko:(excitedly)You can teach me to redirect lightning?\n\n",

"Iroh: Come on. You've got to feel the flow.\n\nIroh: Excellent! You've got it!\n\nZuko: Great! I'm ready to try it with real lightning!\n\nIroh: What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous.\n\n",

"Zuko:(annoyed)I thought that was the point:(Cut to Iroh, whose eyes twitch as Zuko continues.)you teaching me how to protect myself from it.\n\nIroh: But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you are lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all.\n\n",

"Sokka:(frantic)Aang, this is bad! You gotta get me outta here!\n\nSokka: This is really bad!(Cut to Aang, who looks increasingly worried as Sokka speaks.)Please, Aang! You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!\n\n",

"Aang: Oh no! Whoo-hoo! Look at me!\n\nSokka:(terrified)Please don't leave me again.\n\nAang:(determined)I won't.\n\nSokka: What are you doing here?\n\n",

"Aang:(forcefully)Enough! I want my stuff back!\n\nToph: Do it now.\n\nAang:(still angry)What?\n\nToph: Earthbend, twinkletoes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me",

"Toph: DO IT!\n\nToph:(excitedly)You did it! You're an earthbender.\n\nAang:(happily)I can't believe it!\n\nSokka: Aww, this is really a wonderful, touching moment. So, could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?\n\n",

"Aang: No problem, Sokka!\n\nToph: Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him.\n\nSokka: Yeah, no crushing, please.",

"Sokka: The whole time that I was in that hole, not knowing if I would live or die, it makes a man think about what's really important. I realized...\n\nAang:(cutting Sokka off)Hey, Katara, look what I can do!\n\n",

"Katara: You did it! I knew you would!(She glances at Toph.)You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?\n\nToph: Yep. It worked wonders.\n\n",

"Aang: Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted! Physically and mentally unmovable!\n\n",

"Zuko:(defiantly)You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it! And now I can give it back! Come on! Strike me! You've never held back before!\n\n",

"Toph: A lot actually. There's hundreds of little-\n\nAang:Shhh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch.\n\n",

"Sokka:Orchestra, huh? Well la dee da.\n\nSokka:This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans.\n\n",

"Toph:We did make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.\n\nSokka:There's no time for vacations.\n\n",

"Aang:(Looking up at Sokka)I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.(Cut to a close up of Aang.)I practice hard everyday with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrows off.\n\nKatara:Yeah. What's wrong with having a little fun in our downtime?\n\n",

"Sokka: Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the fire nation. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? Knock, knock! Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so.",

"Sokka: We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war.\n\nKatara:Alright, we'll finish our vacations, and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.\n\n",

"Aang:Your turn, Katara.(cut to a shot from the side of Aang holding the map open and Katara looking at it)Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?\n\nKatara:(placing her finger on the map)How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.\n\n",

"Aang:Oh yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring, and I usually don't use the word pristine. It's one of nature's wonders.\n\nAang:Must have changed ownership since I was here.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:One mango, please.\n\nSokka:I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy.\n\n",

"Sokka:(signaling to the bartender)Excuse me!\n\nAang:(looking up at the man)No worries, I clean up easy.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(in awe)You're a living relic!\n\nAang:Thanks. I try.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:An Air Nomad, right in front of me. Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.(grabs Aang's hand and examines it)Tell me, which of the Air temples do you hail from?\n\nAang:The southern temple.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(begins measuring Aang's skull with a pair of calipers and speaking excitedly)Oh, splendid! Now tell me, what was the primary agricultural product of your people?\n\nAang:(nervously)Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(placing a hand on Aang's shoulder)Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal.\n\nSokka:So professor, you're obviously a well traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:Certainly.\n\nSokka:What, no Fire Nation?(straitening his back)Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(voice over)All in vain, I'm afraid.(Cut to a shot of Zei and Katara)I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom,(raises his fist slightly)but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel... Wan Shi Tong's Library.\n\n",

"Toph:You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?\n\nProfessor Zei:This library is more valuable than gold, little lady.(raises his palms in a gesture)It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge... is priceless.\n\n",

"Toph:(sarcastically)Mm, sounds like good times.\n\nProfessor Zei:Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great knowledge spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his foxy knowledge seekers.\n\n",

"Sokka:Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?\n\nKatara:(giving Sokka's head a small shove)I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.\n\n",

"Toph:(waving her hand to gain the others attention)Uh, hey? What about me? When do I get to pick?\n\nSokka:(crossing his arms)You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:Of course there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert, and almost died each time.(in a depressed voice)I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross.\n\nSokka:Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?\n\n",

"Professor Zei:Tell me, sky bison. Are you the last of your breed?\n\nProfessor Zei: Oh, delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue. Oh, the stories this beast could tell.(Momo comes to sit next to Zei and begins chattering.) Shush, chatty monkey.\n\n",

"Aang:Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.\n\nToph:(frustrated)Aw, does this place even exist?\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(smiling and holding his finger up)Some say it doesn't.\n\nToph:Shouldn't you have mentioned that before?\n\n",

"Toph:(in excitement)There it is!\n\nToph:That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it.\n\n",

"Katara:It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air.\n\nSokka:Down there. What's that?\n\n",

"Katara:(disappointedly)Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. The building in this drawing is enormous.\n\nSokka:What kind of animal is that?\n\n",

"Professor Zei:I think that was one of the knowledge seekers.\n\nProfessor Zei:Oh, we must be close to the library!\n\n",

"Sokka:No, thisisthe library.(points up at the spire)Look!\n\nSokka:(voice over)It's completely buried.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nProfessor Zei:(voice over, shouting)The library is buried!\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(depressed)My life's ambition is now full of sand.\n\nProfessor Zei:Well, time to start excavating.\n\n",

"Toph:I say you guys go ahead without me.\n\nKatara:You got something against libraries?\n\n",

"Toph:I've held books before, and I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me.\n\nKatara:Oh, right. Sorry.\n\n",

"Toph:Let me know if they have something you can listen to.\n\nAang:(petting Appa)Don't worry buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph.\n\n",

"Toph:What's up?\n\nProfessor Zei:(in awe)Oh, it's breath taking. The spirits spared no expense designing this place.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:Look at those beautiful buttresses!\n\nProfessor Zei:What's funny?\n\n",

"Aang:Nothing. We just like architecture.\n\nProfessor Zei:(smiles)As do I.\n\n",

"Professor Zei:(amazed)My word!\n\nProfessor Zei:The exquisite mosaic handiwork of this tile-rendered avian symbol...(Cut to a shot of the group as they all stare at Zei in confusion.)Eh, nice...owl.\n\n",

"Owl:I know you're back there.\n\nProfessor Zei:(excitedly)Hello! I'm Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.\n\n",

"Owl:You should leave the way you came,(the owl turns his head to the left)unless you want to become a stuffed head of anthropology.\n\nSokka:Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?\n\n",

"Owl:Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, he who knows 10,000 things. And you are obviously humans, which by the way are no longer permitted in my study.\n\nAang:What do you have against humans?\n\n",

"Sokka:(smiling nervously and waving his hand in protest)What? Oh, no, no, no destroying, we're not into that.\n\nWan Shi Tong:(voice over)Then why have you come here?\n\n",

"Sokka:(trying to think of an answer)Um, knowledge, for, knowledge's sake.\n\nWan Shi Tong:If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it.\n\n",

"Wan Shi Tong:Hmm, very well. I'll let you peruse my vast collection, on one condition. To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge.\n\nProfessor Zei:Please accept this tome as a donation to your library.\n\n",

"Wan Shi Tong:First edition, very nice.\n\nKatara:I have an authentic waterbending scroll.\n\nWan Shi Tong:Oh... these illustrations are quite stylish.",

"Sokka:It's a special knot! That counts as knowledge.\n\nWan Shi Tong:(after a brief pause)You're not very bright, are you?\n\nWan Shi Tong:Enjoy the library.\n\nSokka:Bright enough to fool you.\n\n",

"Toph:So, you like flyin'?\n\nToph:Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see. Well, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet, but this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy.\n\n",

"Aang:Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.\n\nSokka: Eh, I've seen weirder.\n\nKatara:Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left handed?\n\n",

"Aang:I always knew I was special.\n\nSokka:(reading)The darkest day in Fire Nation history. It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.\n\n",

"Aang:Sokka, where are you going?\n\nSokka:I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising.(Cut to a shot of the group running through the library.)The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.\n\n",

"Aang:Firebender.\n\nKatara:They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Sokka:(frustrated)That's so unfair!(places his hands against his head)Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.\n\nSokka:I need to know what happened on the darkest day.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hello, little weird fox guy.\n\nProfessor Zei:Seems it's trying to assist you.\n\n",

"Sokka:Um, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you.\n\nProfessor Zei:This room is a true marvel. A mechanical wonder!(places his hands on his head and smiles)It's a planetarium that shows the heavens moving.\n\n",

"Sokka:Uh, this is beautiful, but, how is it helpful?\n\nKatara:Maybe these dials represent dates and times.(points to the dials)Sokka, try entering that date from the parchment you took.\n\n",

"Sokka:Shh! Katara!(places his hand in front of his mouth and begins whispering, eyeing the fox warily)Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.\n\nAang:Wow, I gotta hand it to you Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation, for sure.\n\n",

"Katara:Hey wait, what happened to the sun?\n\nAang:Great, you must have broken it.\n\n",

"Sokka:It's not broken.\n\nSokka:(voice over)The sun is behind the moon, it's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it! Something awful happened on that day, I don't know what, but I do know why.",

"Sokka:Firebenders loose their bending during a solar eclipse! Sorry.\n\nKatara:That makes sense.(Cut to a close shot of Sokka and Aang as Katara walks in from the right.)I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.",

"Sokka: Fine, you earned it.\n\nSokka:We've got to get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse,(cut to a close up of Sokka)then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is goin' down!\n\n",

"Wan Shi Tong:You betrayed my trust.From the beginning you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes.\n\nSokka:You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. We need this information.\n\n",

"Wan Shi Tong:You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified? Countless others before you have come here, seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.\n\nAang: We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.\n\n",

"Wan Shi Tong:And now I'm going to protect what I love.\n\nAang:What are you doing?\n\nWan Shi Tong:I'm taking my knowledge back. No one will ever abuse it again.\n\nKatara:He's sinking the building! We've gotta get out of here!\n\n",

"Wan Shi Tong:I'm afraid I can't allow that.(cut to a close up of Wan Shi Tong)You already know too much.\n\nToph:I already told you, I don't want to snuggle.\n\n",

"Toph:The library's sinking. The library's sinking!\n\nProfessor Zei:(frightened and exasperated)Great knowledge spirit, I beg you. Do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes.\n\n",

"Aang:We've gotta get back to the surface.\n\nKatara:(voice over)Sokka, let's go!\n\n",

"Sokka:But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna happen.\n\nKatara:Don't be stupid, we'll find out later.\n\n",

"Sokka:No, we won't.(gestures to the side)If we leave this place we'll never get the information.(raises fist)Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover.\n\nSokka:(voice over)Katara, take Momo and get out of here.\n\n",

"Sokka:Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.(removes his bag from his shoulder and turns the dial)\n\nAang:You can't possibly check every single date.\n\n",

"Sokka:I don't have to.(turns the dial)We just have to check every date before Sozin's comet arrives, because after that... Well, try not to think about that.\n\nAang:Come on, eclipse!\n\n",

"Sokka:(voice over)That's it, the solar eclipse!(cut to a wide shot of the planetarium as it darkens)It's just a few months away.\n\nSokka:Got it.(puts the date into his bag)Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.\n\n",

"Toph:Don't make me put this down.\n\nToph:No, stop sinking!\n\nToph: No! (sadly) I'm sorry Appa.",

"Wan Shi Tong:At least I'll have one specimen to add to my collection.\n\nWan Shi Tong: Your waterbending won't do you much good here. I've studied Northern Water Style, Southern Water Style, even Foggy Swamp Style.\n\nSokka:That's called Sokka style. Learn it!",

"Katara:Just go!\n\nSokka:We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming.(Katara and Sokka jump at and hug each other. Momo jumps off of Katara's shoulder)The Fire Nation's in trouble, now!\n\n",

"Toph:I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and -(Toph swings her arms wide.)\n\nAang:You could have come to get us! I could have saved him!\n\n",

"Toph:I can hardly feel any vibrations out here. The sandbenders snuck upon me and there wasn't time for -\n\nAang:You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives.\n\nSokka:Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here.\n\n",

"Aang:That's all any of you guys care about: yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!(Aang stalks off, sulking angrily.)\n\nKatara:We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.\n\n",

"Aang:I'm going after Appa.\n\nKatara:Aang, wait!\n\n",

"Katara:We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba-Sing-Se.\n\nSokka:You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?\n\n",

"Zuko:Maybe we should make camp.\n\nIroh:(in a pained voice)No, please, don't stop for me!\n\n",

"Iroh:(annoyed)What now?\n\nIroh:Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!\n\n",

"Mongke: If you're surprised we're here then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps.\n\nZuko:You know these guys?\n\n",

"Iroh:Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapons specialist.  They are also a very capable singing group.\n\nMongke:We're not here to give a concert. We're here to apprehend fugitives!\n\n",

"Iroh:Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kachi?  I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?\n\nMongke:Enough stalling! Round 'em up!\n\n",

"Iroh: It's nice to see old friends.\n\nZuko:Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.\n\nIroh:Hmm... Old friends that don't want to attack me...",

"\n\nSokka:(breathing hard)Can't you watch where you're -\n\nToph:No.\n\nSokka:Right. Sorry.\n\nKatara:Come on guys, we've got to stick together.\n\nSokka:If I sweat any more, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.\n\n",

"Toph:Katara, can I have some water?\n\nKatara:Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.\n\nSokka:We're drinking your bending water? You used this on the swamp guy!\n\nToph:It does taste swampy.\n\n",

"Katara:I'm sorry, it's all we have.\n\nSokka:Not anymore! Look!\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!(Katara grabs Toph's wrist and runs over to Sokka and Momo.)\n\nSokka:There's water trapped inside these!(Sokka holds up some cactus for Katara, but she backs away, pushing Toph back as well.)\n\n",

"Katara:I don't know...\n\nSokka:Suit yourself. It's very thirst-quenching, though.\n\n",

"Sokka:(In a strange, echoing voice)Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier.(moves across the sand like an inch worm)It's the quenchiest!\n\nKatara:Okay, I think you've had enough.\n\n",

"Sokka:Who lit Toph on fire?\n\nToph:Can I get some of that cactus?\n\n",

"Katara:I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.\n\nSokka:How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?\n\n",

"Katara:Uhhh...\n\nAang: Appa! Appa! (Stares across the horizon but sees nothing)No... NO!\n\n",

"Katara:What is that?\n\nToph:What? What is what?\n\n",

"Sokka:It's a giant mushroom! Maybe it's friendly!\n\nKatara:Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay...\n\n",

"Sokka: (in the echoing voice from before) Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!",

"Katara:I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now, but we need to focus on getting out of here.\n\n",

"Aang:(hopelessly)What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it.\n\nKatara:Come on, Aang! We can do this if we work together. Right, Toph?\n\n",

"Toph:As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'.\n\nKatara: Sokka?  Any ideas how to find Ba-Sing-Se?\n\n",

"Sokka:Why don't we ask the circle birds?\n\nKatara:Ugh... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody hold hands. We can do this. We have to.\n\n",

"Toph:Is there any more water?\n\nKatara:This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.\n\n",

"Sokka:Momo, no! You've killed us all!\n\nKatara:No, he hasn't.\n\n",

"Sokka:Oh, right. Bending.\n\nKatara:Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.\n\n",

"Sokka:(offended) What! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that?!(pointing an accusing finger at Momo)It was you! You ratted me out!\n\nKatara:Sokka, I was there. (takes Sokka's bag)\n\n",

"Aang: It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.\n\nKatara:No, but we can find out which way Ba-Sing-Se is. Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.\n\n",

"Zuko:No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers.\n\nIroh:So do we.(pointing)Ah, this is interesting. I think I've found our friend.\n\n",

"Zuko:You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?\n\nIroh:: I don't think this is a gamble.\n\n",

"Xin Fu:Let's take them now!\n\nMaster Yu:This place is full of desperate characters. If they find out we're collecting a bounty, we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize. Patience.\n\n",

"Iroh:May I have this game?\n\nPai Sho Player:The guest has the first move.(Iroh places the lotus tile in the middle of the board)I see you favor the white lotus gambit. Not many still cling to the ancient ways.\n\n",

"Iroh:Those who do can always find a friend.\n\nPai Sho Player: Then let us play.\n\n",

"Pai Sho Player:Welcome, brother. The White Lotus opens wide to those who know her secrets.\n\nZuko:What are you old gasbags talking about?\n\n",

"Iroh:I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.\n\nXin Fu:I'm not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping! It's over! You two fugitives are coming with me!\n\n",

"Pai Sho Player:I knew it! You two are wanted criminals with a giant bounty on your heads!\n\nZuko:I thought you said he would help!\n\n",

"Iroh:He is. Just watch.\n\nPai Sho Player:You think you're going to capture them and collect all that gold?\n\n",

"Katara:Come on, get up. We need to go.\n\nToph:Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much.\n\n",

"Aang:I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.\n\nKatara:Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.\n\n",

"Aang:(joyfully)Appa!\n\nSokka:Appa? But why would Princess Yue need him? She's the moon! She flies by herself!\n\n",

"Katara:(sadly)It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud!(To AangHere, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.\n\nKatara:Wow... there's hardly any in here.\n\n",

"Aang:(angrily)I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing! What are you doing?\n\nKatara:Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head in this direction.\n\n",

"Toph:Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going! And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert?!\n\nKatara:A boat?\n\n",

"Toph:Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations.\n\nKatara:It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here!",

"Iroh:You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.\n\nDoorman:Who knocks at the guarded gate?\n\nIroh:One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.\n\nIroh:I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here.\n\n",

"Katara:The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.\n\nSokka:(dreamily)Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.\n\n",

"Katara:(gasps)That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert.\n\nToph:(happily)A rock?  Yes! Let's go!\n\n",

"Katara:Maybe we can find some water there!\n\nAang:(darkly)Maybe we can find some sandbenders.\n\n",

"Toph:Ahhh... Finally! Solid ground!\n\nSokka:(breathes deeply)I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look!\n\n",

"Sokka:This tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww I feel woozy.\n\nKatara:(irritated)You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you justlicksomething you find stuck to the wall of a cave?!\n\n",

"Sokka:I have a natural curiosity.\n\nToph:I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something.\n\n",

"Aang:Yeah... look at the shape.\n\nToph:There's somethingbuzzingin here. Something that's coming for us!\n\n",

"Toph:Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!\n\nSokka:I got this one.\n\nKatara:Sokka, there's nothing there.\n\nSokka:I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.\n\n",

"Katara:We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend!\n\nAang:Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.\n\n",

"Katara:Come on, we're going down.\n\nKatara:Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire!\n\n",

"Sokka:Yeah! You got it! She got it, right?\n\nKatara:Yes. Now let's move.\n\n",

"Iroh:Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba-Sing-Se.\n\nZuko:Ba-Sing-Se? Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital?\n\n",

"Pai Sho Player: The city is filled with refugees. No one will notice two more.\n\nIroh:We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city.\n\n",

"White Lotus Member:I have the passports for our guests, but there are two men out on the streets looking for them.\n\nXin Fu:You seen these guys?\n\n",

"Sha-Mo:What are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer? From the looks of it, you stole it from the Hami tribe.\n\nKatara:We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba-Sing-Se.\n\n",

"Sandbender #1:You dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a stolen sand sailer?\n\nSha-Mo:Quiet, Gashuin. No one accused our people of anything. If what they say is true, we must give them hospitality.\n\n",

"Gashuin:Sorry, father.\n\nToph:I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa.\n\n",

"Katara:Are you sure?\n\nToph:I never forget a voice.\n\n",

"Aang:(angrily)You stole Appa! Where is he  What did you do to him\n\nGashuin:They're lying! They're the thieves!\n\n",

"Aang:Where is my bison?!\n\nXin Fu:Hey you, where are these men? I got a tip that they're in your shop.\n\n",

"Florist:(calmly) As you can see, no one is here but us.\n\nMaster Yu:We know all about your secret back room.(to Xin Fu)Kick it down.\n\n",

"Florist:Hey! That room is for flowers only!\n\nMaster Yu:Some unlucky soul has an incomplete Pai Sho set.\n\n",

"Xin Fu:(Growls angrily and knocks the tile out of Master Yu's hand)Let's go back to finding the girl.\n\nAang:You tell me where he is now!\n\n",

"Sha-Mo:(To Gashuin)What did you do?\n\nGashuin:I-It wasn't me!\n\n",

"Toph:You said to put a muzzle on him!\n\nAang:(enraged)YoumuzzledAppa?!\n\n",

"Gashuin:I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the Avatar!\n\nAang:(In an unearthly voice)Tell me where Appa is!\n\n",

"Gashuin:(frightened)I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba-Sing-Se by now! They were going to sell him there! Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!\n\nSokka:Just get out of here! Run!\n\n",

"Sokka:(holding out dripping map)Sure, 5000 year old maps from the spirit library, just splash some water on 'em.\n\nKatara:Sorry.\n\n",

"Toph:You're sure that's the best way to go?\n\nSokka:It's the only way, I mean it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.\n\n",

"Katara:(surprised)Oh, well, ok. I'm glad you're doing better.\n\nSokka:(rolling map)Then to Ba Sing Se we go, no more distractions.\n\n",

"Than:(calling out)Hello there fellow refugees!\n\nAang:So, are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too?\n\n",

"Than:Sure are, we're trying to get there before my wifeYing has her baby.(rubs her large belly)\n\nKatara:Great, we can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.(the three travelers react with horror.)\n\n",

"Ying:(fearfully)The Serpent's Pass?! Only the truly desperate take that deadly route.\n\nToph:Deadly route.(whacks Sokka's arm painfully)Great pick, Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka:Well, we are desperate.\n\nThan:You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.\n\n",

"Ying:And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it.\n\nKatara:(sarcastically)Hmmm, peaceful ferry ride...or deadly pass?\n\n",

"Katara:I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.(cuts to a scene of refugee camp, showing a woman feeding a crying child)\n\nTahn:(voice over)We're all looking for a better life. Safe, behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.\n\n",

"Iroh:(solemnly) Who would have thought, after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace...as a tourist",

"Zuko:(grimly)Look around, we're not tourists, we're refugees. Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt... I'm tired of living like this.\n\n",

"Jet:Aren't we all?(camera pans to show a stalk of prairie grass, leading to  the silhouette of Jet's face as he adopts a sly grin)My name's Jet, and these are my  freedom fighters, Smellerbee, and Longshot.\n\nSmellerbee:Hey.(Longshot nods a greeting)\n\n",

"Zuko:Hello.\n\nJet:(stepping closer) Here's the deal. I hear the Captain's eating like a king, while us refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it?\n\n",

"Iroh:What sort of \"king\" is he eating like?\n\nJet:The fat, happy kind.(Iroh's mouth gapes open, drooling)You want to help us \"liberate\" some food?\n\n",

"Zuko:(turns)I'm in.\n\nBureaucrat:(angrily)I've told you already, no vegetables on the ferry!(A familiar old man looks up in desperate denial)One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se. Security!(points offscreen)\n\n",

"Cabbage Merchant:(horrified)Dah! My Cabbages!!\n\nBureaucrat:(stampingpaper)Next!\n\n",

"Aang:(hesitantly)Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.\n\nBureaucrat:Passport.\n\n",

"Aang:Uh, no one told us we had to have passports.\n\nSokka:(stepping forward)Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!\n\nBureaucrat:(unimpressed)Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day, and by the way, not a very impressive costume.",

"\n\nBureaucrat:Besides, no animals allowed.(threateningly)Do I need to call security?\n\nAang:(holds up hands)That won't be necessary.\n\nBureaucrat:Next!\n\n",

"Toph:(strides forward)I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Bei Fong, and I'll need 4 tickets.\n\nBureaucrat:(awed)Oh! The Golden Seal of the Flying Boar, it is my pleasure to help anyone of the Bei Fong family.(The Bureaucrat bows with a flourish.)\n\n",

"Toph:(arrogantly)It is your pleasure. As you can see I am blind, and these three imbeciles are my valets.\n\nBureaucrat:(hesitantly)But the animal ...\n\nToph:Is my Seeing-Eye Lemur.",

"Bureaucrat:Well, normally it's only 1 ticket per passport, but, this document is so official, I guess it's worth 4 tickets.\n\nToph:Thank you very much.\n\nSokka:(in file behind the others)Alright, we scammed that lady good!\n\n",

"Suki:(menacingly)Yeah, I've got a problem with you. I've seen your type before, probably sarcastic, think your hilarious, and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.\n\nSokka:(eyes narrowing)Do I know you?\n\n",

"Suki:You mean you don't remember?(yanks him close by his collar)Maybe you remember this.(She places a kiss on his cheek.)\n\nSokka:Suki!!(They hug.)\n\n",

"Suki:(delighted)Sokka, it's good to see you!\n\nKatara:You look so different without your makeup, and the new outfit.\n\n",

"Katara:(sadly) Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.(she looks over at Aang, who looks away)\n\nSuki:I'm so sorry to hear that.(looks at Aang with concern)Are you doing okay?(everyone now looks to him)\n\n",

"Aang:(annoyed)I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me!\n\nYing:(from below)Avatar Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings. Our passports, our tickets. Everything's gone!\n\n",

"Aang:(calling down to them)I'll talk to the lady for you.\n\nBureaucrat:No passports, no tickets!!(stamps the arrow on Aang's brow)\n\n",

"Aang:(pleading)But she's pregnant, and all of their stuff was stolen. You have to make an exception.\n\nBureaucrat: No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy nilly to anyone, there would be no more order, and you know what that means. No more civilization!\n\n",

"Aang:What if we gave them our tickets?\n\nBureaucrat:No!\n\nAang:But...\n\nBureaucrat:(spraying spittle onto Aang)NEXT!!!\n\n",

"Aang:(reassuringly)Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the serpents pass\n\nSokka:I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.\n\nToph:I can't believe you're still complaining about it.\n\n",

"Suki:I'm coming too.(she rushes to catch up to group, clad in her Kyoshi's warrior garb and makeup)\n\nSokka: (cautiously)Are you sure that's a good idea?\n\n",

"Suki:(surprised)Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come?\n\nSokka:I do, it's just...\n\n",

"Suki:(growing annoyed)Just what?\n\nSokka: Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.(Suki walks past him angrily, Sokka looks down and then follows)\n\n",

"Sokka:(voiceover)This is the Serpent's Pass I thought it would be more windy, you know, like a serpent. Hmm, I guess they misnamed it.\n\nYing:(approaching gatepost)Look at this writing, how awful.\n\n",

"Toph:What does it say?\n\nKatara: (stepping forward, reads)It says, \"Abandon hope\".\n\n",

"Ying:(miserably)How could we abandon hope? It's all we have.(buries face in husband's chest)\n\nAang:(evenly)I don't know. The monks used to say that hope is just a distraction. So maybe wedoneed to abandon it.\n\n",

"Katara:(incredulous)What are you talking about?\n\nAang:Hope isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass.(steps through gate)\n\n",

"Katara:(somberly)Ok, if you say so.(everyone begins to follow Aang through the gateway)\n\nSuki:The fire nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side, and they don't want anyone to find out what it is.\n\n",

"Than:(calling out)I'm okay.\n\nSokka:(shouting)They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!\n\n",

"Sokka:Suki, are you ok You have to be more careful! C'mon!\n\nToph: Thanks for saving my life Toph. Hey no problem Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka:Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is? It could give way at any moment.\n\nSuki:(calls after him)Sokka, I'm fine. Stop worrying!\n\nSokka:You're right. You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself...Wait!",

"Suki:(softly)It's a beautiful moon.\n\nSokka:Yeah, it really is.\n\nSuki:(sitting close)Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.\n\nSokka:I know you can.\n\n",

"Suki:Then why are you acting so over protective?\n\nSokka:It's so hard to lose someone you care about.(looks away)Something happened at the North Pole, and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.\n\n",

"Suki: (thoughtfully) I lost someone I cared about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart, and brave, and funny.(Sokka begins to look worried)\n\nSokka:(indignantly)Who is this guy? Is he taller than me? \n\n",

"Suki:(coyly)No, he's about your height.\n\nSokka:Is he better looking?\n\nSuki:It is you stupid!\n\nSokka:Oh... (looks to her wistfully)\n\n",

"Sokka:I can't.\n\nSuki:I'm... sorry.\n\nSokka:(turning away)No, you shouldn't be.(leaves her standing beneath arch)\n\nIroh:So, Smellerbee, that's an unusual name for a young man.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:(peeved)Maybe it's because I'm not a man. I'm a girl! (shoots Iroh a look, rises and walks off)\n\nIroh:(calling after her)Oh, now I see! It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!\n\n",

"Smellerbee:(contrite)I know. You're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks Longshot. (he nods a stern approval)",

"Jet:(eagerly)From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall.\n\nIroh: It is a magnificent sight.\n\nJet:So you've been there before?\n\n",

"Iroh:Once, when I was a different man.(looks away with regret)\n\nJet:(glancing around)I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of. But that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se, for a new beginning. A second chance.\n\n",

"Iroh: That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.(shares a meaningful look with Zuko, while Jet studies them both)\n\nKatara:Everyone single file.\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, I need help.(smiling, he hands staff to Toph and begins bending)\n\nKatara:What is that thing?\n\n",

"Sokka:Suki, you know about giant sea monsters. Make it go away!\n\nSuki:(angrily) Just because I live near the Unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!\n\n",

"Sokka:(beseechingly holds up Momo)Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.\n\nKatara: (outraged)Sokka!\n\n",

"Aang: I'll distract him. Katara, get everyone across.\n\nSokka:(calling out)Toph, come on. It's just ice.\n\n",

"Toph:Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see. Ok, I'm coming! \n\nSokka: You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!\n\nToph:(acidly)It's hard to ignore.",

"Sokka: I'm coming Toph!\n\nToph:(dramatically)Oh Sokka, you saved me.(plants a big kiss on Suki's cheek)\n\nSuki:Actually, it's me.\n\nToph:(fatally embarrassed)Oh...well...heheh.(limply)You can go ahead and let me drown now",

"Ying:(gasps)Oh no!(doubles over, clutching her belly)\n\nSokka:(apprehensively)What's wrong?\n\n",

"Ying:The baby's coming!(the refugee family ease Ying to the ground\n\nSokka:(in rising panic)What! Now! Can't you hold it in or something?\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka, Calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.\n\nSokka:(completely panicking)This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real... human.... thing!\n\n",

"Jet:You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were.(Zuko glances warily at Jet now stands next to him)who You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs, because no one else will.\n\n",

"Zuko: (grimly)I've realized lately, that being on your own isn't always the best path.\n\n",

"Katara: You're doing great Ying.(calling back)Sokka! Where's that water? Get ready to push.(Sokka enters behind her)One, two, three...PUSH!\n\n",

"Katara:(from inside)It's a girl!\n\nToph: (leaning over to Sokka)So, you want to go see the baby? Or are you going to  faint like an old lady again?\n\n",

"Sokka:No no, I'm good this time.(Sokka stands and follows Toph into the tent. Moments later Katara appears at the entrance.)\n\nKatara:Aang, you have to come see this.(steps back inside)\n\n",

"Toph:She sounds healthy.\n\nKatara:(awed)She's beautiful.\n\n",

"Sokka:(dubiously)It's so...squishy looking.\n\nThan:What should we name her?\n\n",

"Ying:(turning to Than)I want our daughter's name to be unique.(looks down at her)I want it to mean something.\n\nAang:(softly)I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me... hopeful again.\n\n",

"Ying:I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope.\n\nThan:That's a perfect name. Hope.\n\n",

"Aang:(thoughtfully) I thought I was trying to be strong, but really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it reminded me of how I feel about Appa.....and how I feel about you.",

"Sokka:See ya in the big city.\n\nToph:Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.(slugs Aang's arm, who winces and rubs it painfully)\n\n",

"Katara: (gently)You'll find him Aang.\n\nAang:(softly)I know. Thank you Katara.\n\n",

"Aang: (glancing over)You ready Momo?\n\nSuki:Sokka, It's been really great to see you again.\n\n",

"Sokka:(stunned)So you came along to protectme?\n\nSuki:(blushing)Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.(looks askance)We were talking, and saying things,(closes eyes)I just got carried away and before I knew it I- (Sokka surprises her with a tender kiss, draws back)",

"Sokka:(gazing into her eyes)You talk too much.\n\nAang:(looks sadly to his lemur friend)Sorry Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(looking away from a periscope)Hmm. What about those muscle-y guys down there?\n\nWar Minister Qin:(walks up and sharply raps the periscope, startling Ty Lee)Please, the drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.\n\n",

"Azula:(condescendingly)Oh, I'm sure it is War Minister Qin. But just to be on the safe side... (in commanding tone)Mai, and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!\n\nMai:(twiddling knives)Finally, something to do.\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa?\n\nAang:I was, but something stopped me. Something big.\n\nSokka:(as platform ascends)Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?\n\nAang:That.\n\n",

"Ying:(despairingly)We made it to Ba Sing Se, and we're still not safe. No one is.(Than and family huddle together.)\n\nEarthbender Guard:(from behind)What are you people doing here? Civilians aren't allowed on the wall.\n\n",

"Aang:(looking determined)I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever's in charge.\n\nGeneral Sung:(smiling)It is an honor to welcome you to the outer wall young Avatar, but your help is not needed.\n\n",

"Aang:Not needed?\n\nGeneral Sung:(smugly)Notneeded. I have the situation under control. I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.\n\n",

"Toph:Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.\n\nGeneral Sung:(pacing back to look out over wastes)Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team.\n\n",

"Sokka:(thoughtfully)That's a good group name, very catchy.\n\nTerra Team Leader:Ready... Attack!\n\n",

"General Sung:(observing from a telescope)We're doomed!(flails arms in a panic)\n\nSokka:(slaps general hard on the face)Get a hold of yourself man!\n\n",

"General Sung:(rubbing cheek)You're right, I'm sorry.\n\nToph:Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now?\n\n",

"General Sung:(meekly approaching Aang in a timid voice)Yes, please.\n\nAang:The question is, how are we gonna stop that thing?\n\n",

"Sokka:Why are you all looking at me?\n\nAang:You're the idea guy.\n\n",

"Sokka:(complaining)So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.\n\nKatara:And also the complaining guy.\n\nSokka:That part I don't mind.\n\n",

"Customs Lady: So, Mr. Lee, and Mr.... umm Mushy is it?\n\nIroh: It's pronounced Moo-shee.\n\nCustoms Lady:(looking up from papers angrily)You telling me how to do my job?\n\nIroh:(stepping closer)Uh, no no no.(speaking charmingly)",

"Iroh:But may I just say that you're like a flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating.\n\nCustoms Lady:(smiling and obviously charmed)You're pretty easy on the eyes yourself handsome.(makes cat-claw gesture)Raorrr. Welcome to Ba Sing se.\n\n",

"Zuko:(snatching his papers from Iroh disgustedly)I'm gonna forget I saw that.\n\nJet:I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us.",

"Smellerbee:You don't know anything about him Jet.\n\nJet:(holding signature grass stalk to mouth)I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:Besides, I thought we were going straight now?\n\nJet:(shrugging)We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think Longshot?\n\n",

"Longshot:(shoots a meaningful look)...\n\nJet:I can respect that.\n\n",

"General Sung: What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured.\n\nKatara:His Chi is blocked.(dissipates the energies)Who did this to you?\n\n",

"Sokka:(an idea suddenly hits him and he begins gesturingwildlyOoo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo!\n\nKatara:Yes?\n\n",

"Sokka:(excitedly)What you just said, that's how we're gonna take down the Drill. The same way Ty Lee took down all these big earthbenders.\n\nToph:(enthusiastically)By hitting its pressure points!\n\n",

"Aang:(looking out a window at the Drill below)We'll take it down from the inside.\n\nToph:(gesturing back towards the Drill)Once I whip up some cover, you're not gonna be able to see, so stay close to me.\n\nToph:Run!\n\n",

"Ty Lee: Hey, look at that dust cloud. It's so...poofy.(looks back to the others with a spaced-out expression) Poof!\n\nWar Minister Qin: Don't worry Princess. I'm sure it's nothing.(Azula looks to Ching doubtfully)\n\n",

"Toph:Everyone into the hole!\n\nSokka:It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing.\n\nToph:(feigning horror)Oh no, what a nightmare.\n\nSokka:Sorry.\n\n",

"Sokka:(pointing ahead and upwards)There!\n\nSokka:(peeking out upside down from the opening)Toph, Come on!\n\n",

"Toph:(looking resigned)No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here.\n\nSokka:Okay, good luck.(both he and Aang disappear up into the Drill)\n\n",

"Sokka:(studying the pipes)I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find it's weak points.\n\nAang:Where are we gonna get something like that What are you doing! Someone's gonna hear us!\n\n",

"Sokka:(confidently)That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it, and when something breaks...\n\nKatara:They come to fix it.\n\n",

"Katara:(appearing behind him)Hi.\n\nSokka:(runs up and takes plans)This'll work, thanks!\n\n",

"Zuko:Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.\n\nJet:Come on, we made a great team looting that Captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.\n\nZuko: I said no.\n\nJet: (mildly surprised) Have it your way.",

"Zuko: What are you doing firebending your tea?! For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move.\n\nIroh:(mournfully)I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but...(Iroh sniffles and the cup is shown overturned in a puddle) that's so sad.\n\n",

"Sokka:(studying plans)Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.\n\nKatara:(crossing arms)What's thiswestuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.\n\n",

"Sokka:(turns and gestures to self)Look, I'm the plan guy, You two(makes rapid chop-chop gestures)are the \"cut stuff up with waterbending\" guys.(strikes a heroic pose)Together, we're Team Avatar!\n\nSokka:(pumping arms in the air)C'mon team, don't quit now, we're-\n\n",

"Katara:(explodes with frustration) Grr! (shoots a menacing glare back at Sokka, who stands  wide-eyed, arms still in air)\n\nSokka:I mean,(recovers and points reassuringly)you're almost there.\n\n",

"Katara:(clearly exhausted)At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.\n\nAang:(sitting down to rest)I don't know how many more of those I have in me.\n\n",

"Sokka:Do you hear that We took it down. We better get out of here fast!\n\nWar Minister Qin:Congratulations crew, the Dill has made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se.\n\n",

"Katara:This is bad, really bad.\n\nSokka:Were putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!\n\n",

"Aang:(pointing upward)Then I'll go to the top of this thing, and deliver the final blow.\n\nSokka:(raising arms)And boom, it all comes crashing down!(sweeps arms down)\n\n",

"Aang:(passionately)Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is counting on us.\n\nSokka:The whole world, minus the Fire Nation that is.\n\n",

"Toph:(straining) C'mon twinkle toes, hurry up!\n\nAang:That's enough, we need to get to the next one!\n\n",

"Azula: (turning from Qin to Mai and Ty Lee) Let's go ladies.",

"Sokka:(Encouragingly)Good work Team Avatar. Now Aang just needs to...(glances up) DUCK!\n\n",

"Aang:(narrowly avoiding a second blast) Whoa!\n\nTy Lee:Wow Azula, you were right, it is the Avatar! (smiles seductively)... and friends.\n\nSokka:(smiles vacantly and waves)Hey.\n\nAang:Guys get out of here, I know what I need to do. \n\n",

"Katara:Wait! You need this water more than I do!\n\nAzula:(reaching intersection)Follow them, the Avatar is mine.(Azula races off after Aang, while Mai and Tai Lee pursue the others)\n\n",

"Katara:(as Sokka struggles with hatch)Slurry pipeline What does that mean?\n\nSokka:(finally opening hatch, peering into it with Katara)It's rock and water mixed together, it means our way out.\n\n",

"Mai:(completely revolted)Ughh, disgusting!\n\nTy  Lee:(peering down)Come on, you heard Azula.Wehaveto follow them.\n\n",

"Mai:She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me, I am not going in that wall sludge juice.\n\nKatara:(fiercely)Why don't you try blocking my chi now circus freak!(stands resolutely with one hand upraised)\n\n",

"Sokka:Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill, then when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!\n\nAang:(pausing)This looks like a good spot Momo. Aggh!\n\n",

"Aang:(shouting upward)General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!\n\nGeneral Sung:(looking down from a great height, he apparently doesn't hear)Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there!\n\n",

"Sokka:(in lecturing tone)Good technique little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!\n\nKatara:(losing temper)You know, I am just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day. You're like a chattering Hog-Monkey!\n\n",

"Sokka:(screaming)Just bend the slurry woman!!\n\nToph:(emerging from beneath the Drill)You guys need some help?\n\n",

"Katara:Toph, help me plug up this drain!\n\nAang:(winded)What I'd give to be a metal bender.\n\n",

"Aang:Momo, get out of here!\n\nAang:(scratchingMomo's head)Thanks Momo, I owe you one.\n\n",

"Aang:Now all I need is a...(boulder crashes down startling him)Actually, that is what I needed for once.\n\nToph:Here it comes!(begins raising the three of them up on a pillar of rock)\n\n",

"Smellerbee:Jet, relax! So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal.\n\nJet:He heated it himself!(close-up of furious Jet)Those guys are firebenders.\n\n",

"Sokka:(enthusiastically)I just want to say, good effort out there today Team Avatar.\n\nKatara:(slightly annoyed)Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not gonna catch on.\n\n",

"Sokka:How about...(whips out boomerang, startling Momo)the \"Boomerang Squad!\", see it's good cause it's got \"Aang\" in it.(puts hand on Aang's headBoomer-Aang.\n\nAang:I kinda like that one.\n\n",

"Katara:Let's talk about this on our way into the city.\n\nSokka:The \"Aang Gang\"?\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka.\n\nSokka: The \"Fearsome Foursome\"?\n\n",

"Toph:You're crazy.\n\nSokka:(now alone)Why? We're fearsome!\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey don't jinx it! We could still be attacked by some giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp.\n\nToph:You been hitting the cactus juice again?\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.\n\nKatara:Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.\n\n",

"Aang:It's such a big city.\n\nSokka:He's a giant bison. Where could someone possibly hide him? Oh.\n\n",

"Toph:(sighs) Back in the city. Great.\n\nSokka:What's the problem? It's amazing!\n\n",

"Toph:Just a bunch of walls and rules. You wait; you'll get sick of it in a couple of days.\n\nAang:I'm comin' for you buddy. He's here. I can feel it.\n\n",

"Sokka:Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately.\n\nJoo Dee:Great, let's begin our tour. And then I'll show you to your new home here. I think you'll like it.\n\n",

"Sokka:Augh! Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the King about the war, it's important.\n\nJoo Dee:You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.\n\nJoo Dee: This is the lower ring.\n\n",

"Aang:This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.\n\nIroh:I just want our new place to look nice in case someone brings home a lady friend.(He gives Zuko a small nudge with his elbow.)\n\n",

"Zuko:This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.\n\nIroh:Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not. Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we startthisafternoon.\n\n",

"Jet:Look at them, firebenders living right under everyone's nose.(Smellerbee and Longshot walk up to Jet from an alley.)\n\nSmellerbee:Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea. It doesn't prove he's a firebender. And what if he is, are we supposed to attack them I thought we were starting over here, changing our ways.\n\n",

"Jet:We are, when I get the evidence I need, I'll report them to the police and let them handle it. Ok?\n\nJoo Dee:This is the middle ring of Ba Sing Se, home to the financial district, shops and restaurants and the university.\n\n",

"Sokka:Yeah, we met a Professor from Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that isabsolutely crucial for the King to hear!\n\nJoo Dee:Isn't history fascinating? Look, here's one of the oldest buildings in the middle ring, Town Hall.\n\n",

"Sokka:Is that woman deaf She only seems to hear every other word I say.\n\nToph:It's called \"being handled\". Get used to it.\n\n",

"Tea shop owner:Well, you certainly look like official tea servers. How do you feel?\n\nZuko:Ridiculous.\n\n",

"Iroh:Uh, Does this possibly come in a larger size?\n\nTea shop owner:I have extra string in the back. Have some tea while you wait.\n\n",

"Iroh:Eeow! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!\n\nZuko:Uncle, that's whatalltea is.\n\n",

"Iroh: How can a member of my own family say something so horrible? We'll have to make some major changes around here.\n\nJoo Dee:The Upper Ring is home to our most important citizens. Your house is not too far from here.\n\n",

"Katara:What's inside that wall?\n\nSokka:And who are the mean looking guys in robes?\n\n",

"Joo Dee:Inside is the Royal Palace. Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se. They are the guardians of all our traditions.\n\nAang:Can we see the King now?\n\n",

"Sokka:(stunned)A month!\n\nJoo Dee:Six to eight weeks, actually.\n\n",

"Sokka:I think we'd enjoy it more if we weren't staying so long. Can't we see the King any sooner?\n\nJoo Dee:The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world, but he will see you as soon as time permits.\n\n",

"Aang:If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.\n\nJoo Dee:(bowing)I'll be happy to escort you anywhere you would like to go.\n\n",

"Toph:We don't need a babysitter.(Toph stands up and begins heading for the door.)\n\nJoo Dee:Oh, I won't get in the way.(takes a small step into Toph's path)And to leave you alone would make me a bad host. Where shall we start?\n\n",

"Pet store owner: I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a flying bison. I didn't even know there were any.\n\nAang:If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go?\n\n",

"Student:Hmm, I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here. You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on dessert cultures.\n\nSokka:Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?\n\n",

"Student:(nervous)Uh, I don't know. I'm not a political science student. I have to get to class. Ugh!\n\nJoo Dee:Well, I'm sorry no one has seen your bison. Why don't you go get some rest? Someone will be over with dinner later.\n\n",

"Sokka:(whispering)Hey, come with me.\n\nPao:You're the Avatar. I heard you were in town. I'm Pao.\n\n",

"Sokka:So Pao, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared to talk about the war?\n\nPao:(shifting his eyes left and right)War?scaredWhat do you mean?\n\n",

"Toph:I can feel you shaking.\n\nPao:Look, I'm just a minor government official. I've waited 3 years to get this house. I don't want to get into trouble.(looks left and right to make sure no one is watching)\n\n",

"Katara:Get in trouble with who?\n\nPao:(putting a finger to his lips)Shh, listen, you can't mention the war here, and whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li.\n\n",

"Iroh:Would you like a pot of tea?\n\nZuko:We've been working in a tea shop all day. I'm sick of tea!\n\n",

"Iroh:I borrowed our neighbors, such kind people.\n\nKatara:I've got it! I know how we're gonna see the Earth King!\n\n",

"Toph:How are we supposed to do that? \"One doesn't justpopin on the Earth King\"(mimicking Joo Dee).\n\nKatara:The King is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.\n\n",

"Aang:You mean Platypus-Bear?\n\nKatara:(duly)No, it just says \"Bear\".\n\nSokka:Certainly you mean his pet Skunk-Bear.\n\nToph:Or his Armadillo-Bear.\n\n",

"Toph:This place is weird.\n\nKatara:The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd.\n\n",

"Toph:(lying down)Won't work.\n\nKatara:Why not?\n\n",

"Toph:Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd would spot you from a mile away. You've got no manners.\n\nKatara:(hands on her hips)Excuse me? I've got no manners? You're not exactly lady fancy fingers.\n\n",

"Toph:I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it.(throws the half eaten pastry off to the side)You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late.\n\nSokka:Ah-Ha, but you learned it. You could teach us.\n\n",

"Aang:Ow!\n\nToph:Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys.\n\n",

"Sokka:But I feel so fancy.\n\nAang:Earth!\n\n",

"Sokka:Fire! Augh! Ooh!\n\nAang:Wow, you look beautiful.\n\n",

"Toph:Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society.\n\nKatara:We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:Jet, we need to talk.\n\nJet:What? Oh great, it's you guys. Where have you been? I could use some help with surveillance here.\n\n",

"Smellerbee:We've been talking, and we think you're becoming obsessed with this. It's not healthy.\n\nJet:Oh, really? You both think this?\n\n",

"Smellerbee:We came here to make a fresh start, but you won't let this go. Even though there's no real proof!\n\nJet:Well, maybe if you'd help me.\n\n",

"Jet:Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over. Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless? How they wiped out all the people we loved. If you don't want to help me, I'll get the evidence on my own.\n\n",

"Officer:This is the best tea in the city!\n\nIroh:The secret ingredient is love.\n\n",

"Tea shop owner:I think you're due for a raise.\n\nJet:I'm tired of waiting. These two men are firebenders!\n\n",

"Officer:He works in a tea shop.\n\nJet:He's a firebender, I'm telling you!\n\n",

"Officer:Drop your swords boy, nice and easy.\n\nJet:You'll have to defend yourself. Then everyone will know. Go ahead, show them what you can do.\n\n",

"Zuko:You want a show? I'll give you a show.\n\nGuard:Invitation please.\n\n",

"Toph:I think this will do.\n\nGuard:No entry without an invitation. Step out of line please.\n\n",

"Toph:(irritated)Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us. I'm going to have to tell them who didn't let me in.\n\nGuard:(unyielding)Step out of line please.\n\n",

"Katara:Sir I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.(whispering)She's blind. Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried.\n\nLong Feng:(smiles and bows his head)I am honored, please come with me.\n\n",

"Toph and Katara: Nyah! Pssfft!!\n\nGuest 1:He's taking all the good stuff!\n\n",

"Guest 2:Quiet, you don't know what I had to do to get seats this near the bear!\n\nLong Feng:It's beautiful, isn't it? By the way, I'm Long Feng. I'm a cultural minister to the king.\n\n",

"Katara:I'm Kwa mai, and this is Dung.(Toph frowns and tugs at a string hanging from Katara's headdress.)Ow!\n\nLong Feng:Now where is your family? I'd love to meet them.\n\n",

"Katara:Um... I don't see 'em right now. But I'm sure we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help.\n\nLong Feng:Don't worry, as your escort it would be dishonorable to abandon you ladies without finding your families first. We'll keep looking.\n\n",

"Aang:Or, we could go in with these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys.\n\nSokka:OK, but remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner.\n\n",

"Jet:You must be getting tired of using those swords. Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me.\n\nIroh:Please son, you're confused. You don't know what you're doing!\n\n",

"Jet: Bet you wish he'd help you out with a little fire blast right now.\n\nZuko:You're the one who needs help.\n\n",

"Jet:You see that? The Fire Nation is trying to silence me. It'll never happen.\n\nAang:Where are Toph and Katara?\n\n",

"Sokka:Forget about them, just keep an eye out for the King.\n\nAang:I don't know what he looks like.\n\n",

"Sokka:You know, \"royal\", flowing robe, fancy jewelry.\n\nAang:(voice over)That could be anyone.\n\n",

"Toph:Another crab puff please.\n\nAang:You found us.\n\n",

"Toph:I'd know your little footsteps anywhere Twinkletoes.\n\nSokka:(sarcastically)Thanks for letting us in.\n\n",

"Katara:Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in, won't let us out of his sight.\n\nSokka:What guy?\n\n",

"Joo Dee:What are you doing here? You have to leave immediately, or we'll all be in terrible trouble.\n\nSokka:Not until we see the King.\n\nJoo Dee:You don't understand. You must go.\n\nFemale Guest:Aarrhhh! Oh!\n\n",

"Aang:Sorry! No, don't shout.\n\nFemale Guest:(inawe)The Avatar. Ooh, I didn't known theAvatarwould be here.\n\n",

"Sokka:(whispering)You keep their attention while I look for the King.\n\nAang:Watch this everybody!\n\n",

"Dai Lee Guard 1: Drop your weapons!\n\nJet:Arrest them. They're Firebenders.\n\n",

"Iroh:This poor boy is confused. We're just simple refugees.\n\nTea shop owner:(pointing at Jet)This young man wrecked my tea shop, and assaulted my employees.\n\n",

"Officer:It's true sir. We saw the whole thing. This crazy kid attacked the finest tea maker in the city.\n\nIroh:(blushing)Oh ho ho. That's very sweet.\n\n",

"Dai Lee Guard 2:Come with us son.\n\nJet:You don't understand! They're Fire Nation! You have to believe me!\n\n",

"Sokka:Aang, the Earth King.\n\nAang:Greetings your majesty.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey, let me go.\n\nLong Feng:Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you. I am Long Feng, Grand Secretary of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li. I'd like to talk to you. Your friends will be waiting for us in the library.\n\n",

"Sokka:Why won't you let us talk to the King? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!\n\nLong Feng:The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles and the day to day minutia of military activities.\n\n",

"Katara:So the King is just a figurehead.\n\nToph:(furious)He's your puppet!\n\n",

"Long Feng:Oh, no, no! His majesty is an icon, a god to his people. He can't sully his hands with the hourly change of an endless war.\n\nSokka:But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion...\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent:Calm down, you're safe now.\n\nLong Feng:Our economy would be ruined. Our peaceful way of life, our traditions would disappear.\n\n",

"Dai Li:There's no war in Ba Sing Se.\n\nJet:What are you talking about? Where do you think all the refugees come from? You can't hide it.\n\n",

"Long Feng:In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia. The last one on Earth.\n\nDai Li:There is no war within the walls. Here we are safe. Here we are free.\n\n",

"Katara:You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know.\n\nAang:(defiantly)I'll tell them. I'll make sure everyone knows!\n\n",

"Katara: Huh! Toph, aren't you gonna to get ready for the day?\n\nToph:I'm ready.\n\nKatara:You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your... everywhere actually.\n\n",

"Toph:You call it dirt. I call it a healthy coating of earth.\n\nKatara:Hmmm. You know what we need? A girl's day out!\n\nToph:Do I have to?\n\nKatara:It'll be fun.\n\n",

"Toph:The Fancy Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place.\n\nKatara:Are you ready for some serious pampering?\n\nToph:Sure Katara, whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet.\n\n",

"Toph and Katara:Hahaha!\n\nToph:Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm not usually into that stuff, but I actually feel...girly.\n\n",

"Toph:No, no. That was a good one! \"Like your poodle-monkey\"... Ha ha! You know what else is a good one?\n\nGirls: Ahhh!\n\n",

"Katara:Now that was funny.\n\nKatara:Those girls don't know what they're talking about.\n\nToph:It's ok. One of the good things about being blind is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearances.",

"Toph: I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am.\n\nKatara:That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong and confident and self assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but... you're really pretty.\n\n",

"Toph:(Smiling)I am?\n\nKatara:Yeah. You are.\n\nToph:I'd return the compliment, but I have no idea what you look like.\n\nKatara:(Laughs)\n\nToph:Thank you, Katara.(She punches her in the shoulder in a friendly way.)\n\nKatara:Ow!\n\n",

"Iroh:No, it is not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion.The moonflower likes partial shade.\n\nChild:(crying)Wahh!\n\nWoman:Shhh. It's ok. Shhh.\n\nIroh:(singing)\n\nIroh:Yeowch!\n\nChild:Hahaha!\n\n",

"Mugger:You. Give me all your money!\n\nIroh:What are you doing?\n\nMugger:I'm mugging you!\n\nIroh:With that stance?\n\n",

"Mugger:Ugh!\n\nIroh:With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.\n\nMugger:I know. I'm... I'm just confused.\n\nMugger:So you really think I could be a good masseur?\n\n",

"Iroh:Of course!\n\nMugger:This is so great! No one has ever believed in me.\n\nIroh:While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\n\n",

"Iroh: Happy Birthday my son. (Cut to his face as he begins to cry.) If only I could have helped you.(He begins to sing his song from earlier, only this time he has difficulty keeping his voice from cracking under his grief.)\n\n",

"Zookeeper: Say again?\n\nAang:There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.\n\n",

"Zookeeper:But how are you gonna transport all these wild critters?\n\nAang:(Grinning)Don't worry. I'm great with animals.\n\n",

"Cabbage Merchant: MY CABB--(The rabbiroo looks up at him with a cabbage in its mouth. It chews it a bit and returns to the cart.)--oh, forget it!\n\nAang:(Scratching his head)This was so much easier in my head!\n\n",

"Zookeeper:But youhaveto open this gate!\n\nGuard 1:Or what?\n\n",

"Zookeeper:(Pointing behind himself)Or that!\n\nGuard 2:(Cut back to him standing by the wall)Open the gate!\n\n",

"Aang:Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?\n\nZookeeper:Excellent job, Avatar. You should think about working with animals for a living.\n\n",

"Child visitor:(Pointing into one of the pens)Mommy, Ms. Snowflake got out of the house again.\n\nAdult Visitor:(Shot shows a hissing cat in of the pens)Fluffykins(Cut to the guest's face)What are you doing down there?\n\n",

"Zookeeper:On second thought,(Cut to him and Aang)you should probably stick to saving people.\n\nAang:(Laughs nervously)\n\n",

"Students:(startled)Oooh!\n\nSokka:I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just... wound up... here?\n\n",

"Students:(Laughing and clapping)\n\nMadame Macmu-Ling:(Applauds Sokka)Five seven then five, syllables mark a Haiku, (bowing her head to him) remarkable oaf.\n\n",

"Sokka:(Looking annoyed, then ponders this for a second.)They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe, I am not an oaf.\n\nMadame Macmu-Ling: Chittering monkey, in the spring he climbs treetops, and thinks himself tall.\n\n",

"Students:Ooooh.\n\nSokka:You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.\n\nStudents:Ooooh!\n\nMadame Macmu-Ling:(Walking up to Sokka on stage)Whole seasons are spent mastering the form, the style, none calls it easy!\n\n",

"Sokka:I calls it easy! Like I paddle my canoe,(Turns around and paddles his behind once)I'll paddle yours too!\n\nStudents:(Laughing)\n\n",

"Students:(Laughing)\n\nSokka:(Sheathing his boomerang and making more arm movements)That's right I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an \"okka\", young ladies, I rocked ya!\n\n",

"Security:Uh, that's one too many syllables there, bub.\n\nSokka:...poetry.\n\n",

"Iroh: You're right Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot. Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.\n\nZuko:(Reeling back in surprise)What?!\n\n",

"Jin:(From behind both of them suddenly, causing them to part to show her.)Thank you for the tea.(She hands Zuko a few coins who takes them and turns away from her.)What's your name?\n\nZuko:(Turning back to her)My name's Lee. My Uncle and I just moved here.\n\n",

"Jin:Hi Lee, my name is Jin. Thank you and, well, I was wondering if you would like to go out sometime?\n\nIroh:(Before the stunned Zuko can respond)He'd love to!\n\n",

"Jin:Great! I will meet you in front of the shop at sundown.\n\nJin:Hey. Well, look at you.(She reaches up and messes his hair so it looks normal again.)You look so cute!\n\n",

"Zuko:It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair.\n\nJin:So, how do you like the city so far?\n\n",

"Zuko:It's ok.\n\nJin:What do you like to do for fun?\n\n",

"Zuko:Nothing.\n\nWaiter:(Walking over to address Zuko)Excuse me sir. Would you and your girlfriend care for dessert?\n\n",

"Zuko:(Shouting and pounding the table with his fist)She is not my girlfriend!\n\nZuko:(Trying to find something to say)You have... quite an appetite for a girl.\n\n",

"Jin:Um, thanks So, Lee, where were you and your Uncle living before you came here?\n\nZuko:Um, well, we've been traveling around for a long time.\n\n",

"Jin:Oh! Why were you traveling so much?\n\nZuko:We were uh, apart of this traveling circus.\n\n",

"Jin:Really? What did you do? Wait, lemme guess, you juggled!\n\nZuko:Yes. I juggled.\n\n",

"Jin:I've always wanted to learn how to juggle. Can you show me something?\n\nZuko:Whoah! I haven't practiced for awhile.(He wipes the shards of pottery from his hair.)\n\n",

"Jin:It's alright. Hey, I want to show you one of my favorite places in the city.\n\nJin:I'm so excited for you to see the firelight fountain. The lamps make the water sparkle and reflect in the pool in the most beautiful way.\n\n",

"Jin:I can't believe it! They aren't lit.\n\nZuko:Close your eyes and don't peek.\n\n",

"Zuko:Ok. Now you can look.\n\nJin:Oh wow...(Shot shows the whole area lit by the candles. Jin walks to Zuko looking around in amazement)What happened? How did they light? What did you...?(Zuko simply smiles at her.)\n\n",

"Zuko:I brought you something. It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.\n\nJin:(Taking the coupon)Lee, this is so sweet.\n\n",

"Zuko:(He takes a few steps away from her.)Don't thank me. It was my Uncle's idea. He thinks you're our most valuable customer.\n\nJin:Your Uncle is a good teacher. I have something for you too. Now it's your turn to close your eyes.\n\n",

"Jin:What's wrong?\n\nZuko:It's complicated. I have to go.\n\n",

"Iroh:How was your night, Prince Zuko?\n\nZuko:It was nice.\n\n",

"Suki:Wait. Let me see that.(takes the clump of fur) No. It couldn't be.\n\nSuki:Huh? Appa? Oh no.\n\nSuki: (reassuringly) It's gonna be ok Appa. I have to leave, but I am gonna be back soon with help.\n\n",

"Suki:(addressing the others) No sudden movements. He's been lost for awhile, and he looks like he's hurt. He's shy around people and scared. Stay low, and stay quiet.\n\n",

"Kyoshi Warrior:I can't believe you found the Avatar's bison. Didn't you just see the Avatar a few days ago?\n\nSuki:Yes, so he can't be too far from here. It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet.\n\n",

"Suki:Give him some space! Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend. (walks toward Appa, who moans warily)I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. And we can help you find Aang.",

"Azula: My, my, you're easy to find. It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet.\n\nSuki:What do you want with us?\n\n",

"Azula:(mockingly) Who are you, the Avatar's fan girls?\n\nTy Lee: (thinks for a moment, then brightens) Oh, I get it! I get it. Good one, Azula!\n\n",

"Suki:If you are looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck.\n\nMai:(sighs despondently)I knew this was a waste of time.\n\n",

"Azula:No Avatar huh? (shrugs) Well that's ok, any friend of the Avatar, is an enemy of mine.\n\nMai: (to Suki) You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous.\n\nTy Lee:(hands on hips)You're not prettier than we are!",

"Suki:(drawing her sword)Go Appa! Fly away from here! Get out of here.\n\nSuki: (waving a burning branch)Get out of here! You have to find Aang! We'll be ok!\n\n",

"Guru: I know I am not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of surprises.\n\nGuru:Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed, so twisted up inside.",

"Guru: You're still full of love.(sighs)But fear has moved in where trust should be. I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple",

"Katara:We found a printer to make our posters.\n\nSokka:Hey, I thought designing \"the lost Appa poster\" was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa. \n\nAang:(perplexed)Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.(Katara struggles to contain her laughter)\n\n",

"Sokka:(pointing to the sketch)This IS his head.\n\nKatara:(taking it to study up close)Why are feet coming out of it?\n\n",

"Sokka:(snatching the sketch back indignantly)Those are his horns!(hangs his head)I haven't seen him awhile ok?!\n\nToph:(ironically)It looksjustlike him to me.\n\n",

"Sokka:(flattered)Thank you, I worked really...(realization sets in)Why do you feel the need to do that?\n\nKatara:Let's just stick with the professional version.\n\n",

"Sokka:Grrrr!(violently rips the drawing to tiny shreds)\n\nAang: (enthusiastically)Come on, let's get busy!(holds up two stacks of leaflets)\n\n",

"Quon:Soyou'rethe genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about you.(holds up the teacup in a hand glittering with jeweled rings)I hope Pao pays you well.\n\nIroh:(smiling)Good tea is its own reward.\n\n",

"Quon:But it doesn't have to be the only reward. How would you like to have your own tea shop?\n\nIroh:(stunned)My own tea shop? This is a dream come true.\n\n",

"Pao:(scampering to join conversation)What's going on here? Are you trying to poach my tea maker?(throws himself protectively between Iroh and Quon)\n\nQuon:Sorry Pao, that's business for you, am I right?\n\n",

"Pao:(increasingly desperate)Mushie, if you stay, I will make you Assistant Manager. Wait, Senior Assistant manager.\n\nQuon:I'll provide you with a new apartment in the upper ring. The Tea shop is yours to do whatever you want. Complete creative freedom.\n\n",

"Iroh:(elated)I even get to name the shop?\n\nQuon:Of course!\n\n",

"Pao:(pleading)Uh, SeniorExecutiveAssistant Manager?\n\nIroh:(excitedly)Did you hear nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the upper ring of the city.\n\n",

"Quon:That's right young man. Your life is about to change for the better.\n\nZuko:(gravely)I'll try to contain my joy.(steps outside)\n\n",

"Aang:I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about Appa?\n\nKatara:(studying her cards)It's only been a day, just be patient.\n\n",

"Aang:(popping up eagerly)Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off.(rushes to open the door)Joo Dee?!\n\nJoo Dee:(with usual eerie grin and careful speech)Hello, Aang and Katara and Sokka and Toph.(the other three gather to talk to her)\n\n",

"Sokka:What happened to you? Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?\n\nJoo Dee:(dismissively)What, jail? Of course not. The Dai Li are the protectors of our cultural heritage.\n\n",

"Toph:But you disappeared at the Earth King's party.\n\nJoo Dee: Oh, I simply took a short vacation to Lake Laogai, out in the country. It was quite relaxing.(Sokka's face shows clear suspicion)\n\n",

"Katara:But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee.\n\nJoo Dee:I'mJoo Dee.\n\n",

"Aang:Why are you here?\n\nJoo Dee:(pulling out leaflet)Dropping flyers and putting up posters isn't permitted within the city. Not without proper clearance.\n\n",

"Sokka:(annoyed)We can't wait around to get permission for everything.\n\nJoo Dee:(cheerfully grinning)You are absolutely forbidden by the rules of the city to continue putting up posters.\n\n",

"Aang:(red faced and steaming with frustration, shouting)WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES, AND WE'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON!!(flails his arms in outrage, starts backing an alarmed Joo Dee) We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way!",

"Aang:(glaring at the door) I don't care. From now on we do whatever it takes to find Appa.\n\nToph:(raising arms in the air)YEAH! Let's break some rules!\n\n",

"Long Feng:(softly)Joo Dee, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.(she looks up, and her pupils dilate)\n\nJoo Dee:(calmly)I am honored to accept his invitation.\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent:Should we take care of him?\n\nLong Feng:(holding the scroll, gazes into the fire)No. It's much too dangerous to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this... quietly.\n\n",

"Iroh:So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How ;bout the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.\n\nZuko:The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.(holds out the leaflet)And he's lost his bison.\n\n",

"Iroh:(earnestly)There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want for your life, and why.\n\nZuko:(turning to look outside again)I want my destiny.\n\n",

"Iroh:What that means is up to you.(Zuko walks away from the window)The Tea Weevil!(shakes his head in disgust)No, that's stupid.\n\nSokka:Well split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me.\n\n",

"Toph:(peevishly)Why because you think I can't put up posters on my own?\n\nToph: (dolefully)It's upside-down isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka.(she hands him back the brush, and they all split up)\n\n",

"Jet:Katara?\n\nJet: (smiling confidently)I think I can help you.\n\n",

"Jet:Katara! I've changed!\n\nKatara:Tell it to some other girl, Jet!\n\n",

"Jet:I don't want to fight you! I'm here to help.\n\nSokka:Katara, what is it?\n\n",

"Katara:Jet's back.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Katara:(resolutely)We can't trust anything Jet says.\n\nSokka:But we don't even know why he's here.\n\n",

"Katara:(with a hostile tone)I don't care why he's here. Whatever the reason is, it can't be good.\n\nJet:I'm here to help you find Appa.\n\n",

"Aang:(turning from the leaflet back to Katara)Katara, we have to give him a chance.\n\nJet:(earnestly)I swear, I've changed. I was a troubled person, and I let my anger get out of control. But I don't even have the gang now. I've put all that behind me.\n\n",

"Katara:(bitterly)You're lying!\n\nToph:He's not lying.\n\n",

"Sokka:How can you tell?\n\nToph:I can feel his breathing and heart beat. When people lie, there is a physical reaction. He's telling the truth.(Toph, Aang and Sokka turn to Katara)\n\n",

"Aang:(beseechingly)Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out.\n\nKatara:(shoulders sagging in resignation)Alright...(suddenly stabbing a finger at Jet)but we're not letting you out of out sight!\n\n",

"Jet:This is the place I heard about.(everyone begins looking around)\n\nAang:There's nothing here.\n\n",

"Katara:(angrily)If this is a trap...!(she readies an attack)\n\nJet:I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had. I figured it must be Appa.\n\n",

"Toph:(offscreen)He was here!\n\nAang:(stroking the clump of fur sadly)We missed him.\n\n",

"Janitor:They took that big thing yesterday.(Aang straightens with a shocked look)Shipped him out to some island. About time, I've been cleaning up fur and various, uh leavings all day.(begins walking off again)\n\nAang: What island?! Where's Appa?!\n\n",

"Janitor:(wearily)Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up, guess for a zoo or such, though could be the meat would be good.\n\nAang:(anxiously)We've gotta get to Whaletail Island. Where's Whaletail Island?\n\n",

"Sokka:(glumly)Far. Very far. Here it is. It's near the South Pole almost all the way back home.(Everyone kneels around the map.)\n\nKatara:Aang, It'll take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.",

"Aang:(standing)I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa. We have to try.\n\nJanitor:(passing in the background)Must be nice to visit an island. I haven't had a vacation for years.\n\n",

"Katara:(crossly)Don't you have some more hair to clean up?\n\nJanitor:(dismally)Shuffle on, I get ya. No more need for \"old sweepy.\"\n\n",

"Katara:You're right Aang.(places hand on his shoulder)Right now, our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him.\n\nSokka:(setting off)All right, let's get moving.\n\n",

"Jet:(steppingtowards them)I'll come with you.\n\nKatara:(firmly)We don't need you help.\n\n",

"Jet:Why won't you trust me?(walks after Sokka and Aang)\n\nKatara:(arms crossed)Gee, I wonder?(turns and raises her head in a huff)\n\n",

"Toph:(standing beside her)Was this guy your boyfriend or something?\n\nKatara:(startled)What? No!(turns her head the other direction)\n\n",

"Toph:(teasingly)I can tell you're lyyyyying.\n\nSokka:We can take the train out to the wall, but then we'll have to walk.\n\n",

"Aang:(cheerfully)Don't worry, on the way back, we'll be flying!\n\nToph:(with exaggerated relief)We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.(thows her arms wide)Worst city ever!\n\n",

"Smellerbee:(shouting)Jet!\n\nKatara:(accusingly)I thought you said you didn't have your gang anymore?\n\n",

"Jet:(turns with a bewildered look)I don't.\n\nSmellerbee:We were so worried. How did you get away from the Dai Li?\n\n",

"Katara:(aghast)The Dai Li?!\n\nJet:I don't know what she's talking about?(everyone stops and draws closer to Jet and Smellerbee)\n\n",

"Smellerbee:He got arrested by the Dai Li a couple weeks ago. We saw them drag him away.\n\nJet:(baffled)Why would I be arrested? I've been living peacefully in the city.\n\n",

"Toph:(kneeling down, with a palm on the street between them)This doesn't make any sense. They'rebothtelling the truth.\n\nKatara:That's impossible.\n\n",

"Sokka:(thoughtfully)No, it's not. Toph can't tell who's lying because theyboththink they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed.(points at Jet accusingly)\n\nJet:(distressed)That's crazy! It can't be.(starts looking around in a panic)Stay away from me.\n\n",

"Blue Spirit:Out of my way, skinny.\n\nDai Li Agent:(perplexed)Huh?\n\n",

"Blue Spirit:(menacingly)If you don't want to end up like him. You'll do what I say.\n\nKatara:The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot too.\n\n",

"Aang:(looking to her)I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet.(turns back to Jet)Where did they take you?(Jet is seen sitting on a stool, his head hanging low)\n\nJet: Nowhere. I, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n",

"Aang:We need to find a way to jog his real memories.\n\nSokka:(provokingly)Maybe Katara could kiss him. That should bring something back.\n\n",

"Katara:(annoyed)Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka.\n\nSokka:(slyly)Hey, just an idea.\n\n",

"Aang:(peeved)A bad one.\n\nSokka: Oo, wait. I got it.(Sokka plucks a straw from his mattress, pokes it into Jet's mouth in trademark fashion, then regards him thoughtfully)\n\n",

"Jet:I don't think its working. Puh!(spits it onto the floor)\n\nToph:Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions.\n\n",

"Smellerbee: The Fire Nation, remember what they did to your family.\n\nKatara:Close your eyes. Picture it.\n\n",

"Jet:(shaken)No! It's too painful.\n\nKatara:Maybe this will help.\n\n",

"Jet:(tentatively)They took me to a headquarters under the water, like a lake.\n\nSokka:Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said?  She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai.\n\n",

"Sokka:So where's this secret headquarters?\n\nJet:(scratching his head)Under the lake I think.\n\n",

"Toph:(pointing to her right)There's a tunnel right there near the shore.\n\nJet:(leading the group)It's all starting to come back to me.\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent:I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.\n\nJoo Dees:(in perfect unison)I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent:We are so lucky to have our walls to create order.\n\nJoo Dees:(in perfect unison)We are so lucky to have our walls to create order.\n\n",

"Jet:(once more leading)I think there might be a cell big enough to hold Appa up ahead.(he stops before a sealed stone door)I think it's through here.\n\nZuko/Blue Spirit:Expecting someone else?\n\n",

"Sokka:(as everyone stares up)Now that's something different.\n\nLong Feng:(grimly)You have made yourselves enemies of the state.(The camera pans across the determined faces of the heroes, as Longshot notches an arrow.)Take them into custody.\n\n",

"Aang:Long Feng is escaping!\n\nLong Feng:(threateningly)Alright Avatar, you've caused me enough problems. This is your last chance, ifyou want your bison back.\n\n",

"Aang:(outraged)Youdohave Appa. Tell me where he is!\n\nLong Feng:Agree to exit the city now, and I'll waive all charges against you and allow you to leave with your lost pet.\n\n",

"Jet:(raising his swords)You're in no position to bargain.\n\nLong Feng:(haughtily)Am I not?\n\n",

"Aang:(brandishing his staff)You're definitely not!\n\nLong Feng:Jet, The Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.\n\n",

"Jet:(pupils dilating)I am honored to except his invitation.\n\nBlue Spirit:You're mine now.\n\n",

"Blue Spirit: (taken aback)Uncle?\n\nIroh:(feigning puzzlement)So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask?\n\n",

"Zuko:(removing his mask)What are you doing here?\n\nIroh:I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you have found the Avatar's bison? Keep it locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?\n\n",

"Zuko:First I have to get it out of here.\n\nIroh:(incensed)AND THEN WHAT?! You never think these things through! This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had no where to go!\n\n",

"Zuko:(heatedly)I would have figured something out!\n\nIroh:(shouting angrily)No!! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!\n\n",

"Zuko:(looking away in anguish)I know my own destiny uncle.\n\nIroh:(forcefully) Is it your own destiny? Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?\n\n",

"Zuko:(in torment) Stop it Uncle. I have to do this. (turns away, toward Appa)\n\nIroh:(pleading furiously) I'm begging you Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward, and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you? And what do you want?\n\n",

"Aang:(desperately)Jet, it's me Aang! You don't have to do this.\n\nLong Feng:I'm afraid he no longer has a choice.\n\n",

"Aang:Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart!(Jet, gasping, seems conflicted)\n\nLong Feng:Do your duty Jet.(Jet slowly approaches Aang, swords raised)\n\n",

"Aang: He can't make you do this! You're a Freedom Fighter.\n\nLong Feng:Do it! Do it now!\n\n",

"Long Feng:(contemptuously)Foolish boy. You've chosen your own demise.\n\nJet:(weakly)I'm sorry, Aang.\n\n",

"Aang:(sitting at his side)Don't be.\n\nKatara:(turning to the others)This isn't good.\n\n",

"Smellerbee: You guys go find Appa. We'll take care of Jet.\n\nKatara:We're not going to leave you.\n\n",

"Longshot:(speaking for the first time)There's no time. Just go. We'll take care of him. He's our leader.(The four heroes look at him with expressions of wonder.)\n\nJet:(tenderly)Don't worry Katara, I'll be fine.\n\n",

"Toph:(softly)He's lying.\n\nAang:Appa's gone. Long Feng beat us here.\n\n",

"Sokka:If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up to him.\n\nSokka:(running beside Aang)Do you think we can out run them?\n\n",

"Aang:I don't think it's gonna matter.\n\nAang:What is it Momo?\n\n",

"Aang:Appa!\n\nLong Feng:I can handle you by myself.\n\n",

"Sokka:(hugging his leg)Yeah! Appa!\n\nAang:(head pressed in his fur, crying)I missed you, buddy.\n\n",

"Act I\n\nAang:(ardently)I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.\n\n",

"Sokka:(confidently)Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.\n\nKatara:(critically)One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.\n\n",

"Sokka:We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support.\n\nToph:What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.\n\n",

"Sokka:I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.\n\nKatara: Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.\n\n",

"Toph:I'm with sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se,(raises arms and opens eyes wide)and I can't even see!\n\nAang: But now that we have Appa back, there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth about the conspiracy and the war.\n\n",

"Sokka:See, Aang's with me.(puts arm over smiling Aang's shoulder, flashing a wide grin)It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try.\n\nKatara:(thoughtfully)Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.\n\n",

"Toph:(rising to feet)I don't trust the new positive Sokka. (points accusingly) Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!\n\nSokka:That's probably the Dai Li searching for us.(turns to Katara)So?\n\n",

"Katara:(pauses, then decisively)Let's fly!\n\nToph:(pleading)Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying!(buries face in Appa's back)\n\n",

"Sokka:There it is. That whole thing is the palace. The Earth King's chambers should be in the center.(another shot of the palace, and the vast open plaza in front)\n\nKatara:We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming.\n\n",

"Sokka:Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in....Ahhh!\n\nToph:(shouting over the wind)What was that?!\n\n",

"Sokka:(shouting in alarm)Surface to air rocks!(below, several rows of massive, puck-shaped boulders are being launched skyward by teams of earthbending troops)More incoming! Ahhh!\n\nKatara:Sorry!(winces at the soldiers cries of pain)\n\n",

"Katara:Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King.\n\nSokka:Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side.(soldiers continue to slide past)Sorry.\n\n",

"Sokka:In there.\n\nSokka: Toph, which way to the Earth King?\n\n",

"Toph:How should I know? I'm still voting that we leave Ba Sing Se.\n\nWoman in the Palace:(screaming)Burglar!(tries to run, trips and falls on her face)\n\n",

"Sokka:(closing door behind him)Sorry, wrong door.\n\nIroh:You did the right thing, letting the Avatar's bison go free.(closes door behind him)\n\n",

"Zuko:(feebly)I don't feel right.\n\nIroh:(alarmed)Zuko!(rushes to his nephews side)\n\n",

"Sokka:Nowthat'san impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere.\n\nSokka:A little warning next time! (rubs the back of his head as he rises)\n\n",

"Aang:(urgently)We need to talk to you!\n\nLong Feng:(turning to the king)They're here to overthrow you.\n\n",

"Sokka:No, we're on your side. We're here to help.\n\nKatara:(appealing)You have to trust us.\n\n",

"Earth King:(rising with an aggravated tone)You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me totrustyou?\n\nToph:(sardonically)He has a good point.\n\n",

"Earth King:If you're own my side, then drop your weapons and stand down.(one by one, the heroes drop their weapons to the floor)\n\nAang:(attempting charm)See, we're friends, your Earthiness.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nLong Feng:Detain the assailants.(the Dai Li skate forward to take up positions behind the heroes)\n\n",

"Sokka:(confused)But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.\n\nLong Feng:Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again.\n\n",

"Earth King:(surprised)The Avatar?You'rethe Avatar?(points at Sokka)\n\nSokka:Uh, no,him.(nods his head toward Aang)\n\n",

" Aang:Over here.(effortlessly escaping his bonds, Aang raises up his arms, then allows them to be bound behind him again)\n\nLong Feng:What does it matter Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.\n\n",

"Earth King:(uncertainly)Perhaps you're right.\n\nEarth King:(amused)Though Bosco seems to like him.(turns serious)I'll hear what he has to say.\n\n",

"Aang:(approaching the throne)Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact. The Dai  Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.\n\nEarth King:(dismayed)A secret war? That's crazy!\n\n",

"Long Feng:(derisively)Completely!\n\nAang:(accusingly)Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!\n\n",

"Long Feng:(turning to the King)All lies. I've never evenseena Sky Bison, Your Majesty.(looks aside)Frankly, I thought they were extinct.\n\nEarth King:(sits back on his throne, skeptical)Your claim is difficult to believe, even from an Avatar.\n\n",

"Long Feng:(whispering conspiratorially)These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction.\n\nEarth King:(resigned)I have to trust my advisor.\n\n",

"Sokka:Wait, I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.\n\nLong Feng:(appalled)What?! I am not disrobing!\n\n",

"Aang:Right there! Appa bit him.\n\nSokka:(smugly)Never met a Sky Bison , huh?\n\n",

"Long Feng:(pushing down his robes, feigning embarrassment)That happens to be a large birthmark. Thanks for showing everyone.\n\nEarth King:Well, I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.\n\n",

"Sokka:Of course there is!\n\nEarth King:(convinced)Yup, that pretty much proves it.(Aang slides out of the scene comically)\n\n",

"Gang:(pumping arms in the air)Yeah! Woo!\n\nEarth King:But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory.\n\n",

"Gang:(slumping in disappointment)Awww.\n\nEarth King:Though, I suppose this matter is worth looking into.\n\n",

"Gang:(gesturing uncertainly)Uh, ok, we'll take it. Yeah.\n\nIroh:You're burning up. You have anintensefever.(places cloth over Zuko's brow)This will help cool you down.\n\n",

"Zuko:(feebly)So thirsty.(tries to sit up, but is pushed back down by Iroh)\n\nIroh:Here's some clean water to drink.(ladles water from another bucket, and supports Zuko's shoulders while he drinks)Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out.\n\n",

"Earth King:(uncomfortably)So, this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this... public.(we can now see the rows of passengers seated to either side of him)\n\nKatara:(astonished)So you've never been outside the upper ring before?\n\n",

"Toph:It's gone!\n\nSokka:(raises hands to his face in dismay)Oh, don't tell me..(slumps, then recovers and flashes a thumbs-up)That's ok, still got my positive attitude.\n\n",

"Katara:The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence.\n\nEarth King:(frowning suspiciously)Hmm. That seems awfully convenient.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.\n\nEarth King:(dissatisfied)Long Feng was right, this was a waste of time. If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace.(turns to leave with his guards)\n\n",

"Katara:(suddenly inspired)The wall! They'll never be able to coverthatup in time!\n\nAang:Oh yeah.(Aaag vaults upward, to land in front of the departing King)If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real!\n\n",

"Earth King (annoyed)No Earth King has ever been to the outer wall. I don't have anymore time for this nonsense.(brushes past a sad Aang)\n\nSokka:(rushing up)If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.\n\n",

"Earth King:Ahhhh!\n\nToph:(irreverently)First time flying?\n\n",

"Earth King:(breathlessly)Its both thrilling and terrifying.\n\nToph:Yeah, I hate it too.\n\n",

"Earth King:I have to be honest with you. Part of me really hopes that what you are telling me about this war...isn't true.\n\nAang:(under his breath)I wish it wasn't.\n\n",

"Blue Dragon:(in Azula's voice)It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my Lord?\n\nZuko:I'm not tired.\n\n",

"Blue Dragon: Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go, give into it. Shut your eyes for awhile.\n\nRed Dragon:(in Iroh's insistent voice)No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the Blue Dragon. You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late! \n\n",

"Blue Dragon:Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.\n\nBlue Dragon: (in a rising voice)Sleep, just Like MOTHER!!\n\n",

"Ursa: (plaintively)Zuko, help me!\n\nAang:It's still there!\n\n",

"Earth King:(in wonderment)What is that?\n\nSokka:It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls.\n\n",

"Earth King:(shaken)I can't believe I never knew.(he looks to his right as Long Feng arrives on a stone elevator, flanked by two of his agents)\n\nLong Feng:(reasonably)I can explain this, Your Majesty. This is nothing more than... a construction project. \n\n",

"Earth King:(firmly)Dai Li, arrest Long Feng. I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.\n\nLong Feng:(outraged)You can't arrest me. You all need me more than you know!(is drug away by the agents)\n\n",

"Sokka:(shouting after him mockingly)Looks like Long Feng is \"long gone\"! Ha...Oh, yeah, I've beenwaitin'to use that one.(rubs a tear from one of his eyes)",

"Earth King:What are you suggesting, Sokka?\n\nSokka:(decisively)That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun.\n\n",

"Earth King:Very well. You have my support.\n\nGang:(drawing together)Woo! Alright! Good work team!(Sokka, Toph and Katara hug, as Aang circles them on an air scooter)\n\n",

"General How:(entering the throne room)Your Majesty. I apologize for the interruption. \n\nEarth King:This is General How, he's the leader of The Council of Five. My highest- ranking generals.\n\n",

"General How:(lifting his forehead from the floor)We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody. \n\nGeneral How:There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids.\n\n",

"Aang:Secret files?\n\nEarth King:(reading the address on a rolled up scroll)Toph Bei Fong.(the scroll is handed across to Toph, who hands it to Katara)\n\n",

"Katara:(unrolling and reading)It's a letter from your mom. You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you.(Toph's face lights up in surprise)\n\nToph:(disgusted)Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.\n\n",

"Earth King:(handing another to the Avatar)Aang.\n\nGeneral How:This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.\n\n",

"Aang:(reading)It's from the Eastern Air Temple.\n\nKatara:(hopefully)Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?\n\n",

"Earth King:I'm afraid not.\n\nSokka:(both siblings exchange sorrowful looks)Oh.\n\n",

"General How:But thereisan intelligence report that might interest you.(hands another scroll to Katara)\n\nKatara:(reading)A small fleet of water tribe ships...\n\n",

"Sokka:(eagerly)What? That could be Dad.\n\nKatara:(in rising excitement)Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!\n\n",

"Iroh:You should know this is not a natural sickness. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.(supports Zuko's head as he drinks)\n\nZuko:(disorientated)What? What's happening?\n\n",

"Iroh:You're critical decision, what you did beneath that lake...it was in such conflict with your image of yourself, that you are now at war within your own mind and body.(Zuko takes a second sip of the tea)\n\nZuko:What's that mean\n\n",

"Sokka:What's a Guru? Some kind of poisonous blowfish?(scratches the back of his head)\n\nAang:(eagerly)No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.\n\n",

"Katara:(happily)And I can't believe we know where our Dad is now.(holds the report)\n\nToph:(reassured)I know what you mean. My Mom's in the city, and from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.\n\n",

"Sokka:This is all such big news. Where do we even start?\n\nKatara:I hate to say it, but...we have to split up.\n\n",

"Aang:(distraught)Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together. Now you want us to separate?\n\nKatara:(firmly)You have to meet this Guru, Aang. If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.\n\n",

"Aang:(smiling)Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple. Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.\n\nSokka:(resigned)Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me?\n\n",

"Katara:(rises)No Sokka, I know how badly you want to help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king.\n\nSokka:(tears welling in his eyes)You are...the nicest... sister...ever.\n\n",

"Katara:(pushes him back)Easy there, big brother.(pleased)Though you're right, I am.\n\nAang:(softly)Katara, I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to say it for a long time.(blushes and looks down)\n\n",

"Katara:(curiously)What is it Aang?\n\nAang:(hesitantly, still blushing)Katara, I...\n\n",

"Guard:Your Majesty. There are three female warriors here to see you, they're from the island of Kyoshi.\n\nSokka:(shocked)That's Suki!!(freezing while climbing Appa's side, he slips and falls to the stone plaza, sits up, and begins rubbing his sore back)\n\n",

"Earth King:You know these warriors?\n\nSokka:( rising, speaking confidently)Oh yeah. The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too. They're good friends of ours.\n\n",

"Earth King:(satisfied)Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.\n\nKatara:(turning to the departing Avatar)Wait, Aang.\n\n",

"Toph:(quietly)I'm really gonna miss you guys.\n\nKatara:Me too.\n\n",

"Aang:Yeah.\n\nSokka:(embarrassed)Ahhh! Great! That's enough! Ok, we love each other.(pats Katara and Aang's head)Seriously.\n\n",

"Zuko:Ahhhh!(sitting up in a jolt, he breathes heavily, eyes wide)\n\nSokka:(smugly)You see Aang, a little positive thinking works wonders. We got the King on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.\n\n",

"Aang:(love-struck)Yeah, girls are waiting for us. Thanks \"positive attitude\".\n\nSokka:(cheerfully)Everything's gonna work out perfectly, from now on and forever.(Aang turns and shares his smile)\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent:Dinner.(in a low voice)The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King, but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir.(walks away)\n\nToph:Hello? Mom? Anyone home?\n\n",

"Toph:(frightened)Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with?!(outside, two figures drop down from above)\n\nXin Fu:One loud mouth little brat who strayed too far from home.(Xin Fu and Master Yu stride out of the shadows toward the trap)\n\n",

"Zuko: What's that smell?(Iroh is seen stirring a thick white paste in a steaming pot.)\n\n",

"Iroh:(doubtfully)It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.(Zuko bows over the pot, inhaling, as Iroh steps back.)\n\nZuko:(pleasantly)Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle.(The banished Prince picks up and holds out a bowl.)\n\n",

"Iroh:(suspicious)Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow. \n\nZuko: It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. Things are looking up Uncle.\n\n",

"Aang:(enthusiastically)You haven't seen your Dad in over two years. You must be so excited.\n\nSokka:(visibly nauseous)I know I should be, but I just feel sick to my stomach.\n\n",

"Aang:(reassuringly)Don't be nervous, he's going to be so happy to see you.(places arm on Sokka's shoulder, causing him to smile slightly)\n\nSokka: So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this Guru?\n\n",

"Aang:(confidently)Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes.(Sokka drops off of Appa's back, looks up at Aang)See you in a week. Yip Yip!\n\nWater Tribe Warrior: Sokka, good to see you.\n\n",

"Earth King: Look Bosco, the Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us. Aren't you excited?\n\nEarth King:(turning serious)It's been a difficult week for me. My most trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me.\n\n",

"Azula: It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.\n\nEarth King: But there is good news. As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of The Fire Nation this summer. On the day of a solar eclipse.\n\n",

"Azula:(feigning enthusiasm) Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan.\n\nGeneral How: General Fong's base will serve as the launching point of the attack. In exactly two months, the Army and Navy will invade the Fire Nation on The Day of Black Sun.\n\n",

"Katara:(amused)Or we could send in Momo to do some damage.\n\nKatara:(laughing)Cause the...(continues to laugh, then notices the grim expressions of the Council)...sorry.\n\n",

"General How: All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan.(places a scroll on a section of the map frame, which he bends across the map to Katara)\n\nKatara:(respectfully)I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How.\n\n",

"Aang:(uncertainly)Um, hello?(hops down, starts up stairs)You're Guru Pathik, right? The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?\n\nGuru Pathik: Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people, and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.\n\n",

"Aang:(appalled)Ugh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!\n\nGuru Pathik: That's because it is.(Pathik empties another bowl, and holds it over his head like a ridiculous hat)Yum yum!\n\n",

"Master Yu:(insistently)I believe we need to go right!(points that direction)\n\nXin Fu:(stops the wagon)What are you talking about? The Bei Fong Estate's this way.\n\n",

"Master Yu: I'm quite certain you're mistaken.(both turn to the sound of loud banging from the box)\n\nToph:(urgently shouting)Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? I gotta go to the bathroom!(she is seen standing inside the dark box)\n\n",

"Master Yu:(hesitantly)Oh. Okay, but make it quick.\n\nXin Fu:(grabbing Yu's arm)What's wrong with you!\n\n",

"Master Yu: Oh very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me.(tosses key in his palm, resumes seat)\n\nToph:(furious)Let me out of here, so I can kick both your butts!(bangs on walls)\n\n",

"Xin Fu:(angrily)Quit your banging.(strikes the side of box)You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but evenyoucan't bend metal.\n\nAzula: We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(teasingly) Mai finally gets to wear makeup that's not totally depressing?\n\nMai: Ha. Ha. (she has large, dark splotches of makeup beneath her eyes)\n\n",

"Azula: I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom.(the two girls turn with shocked looks)\n\nAzula: For a hundred years the fire nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside. But now we are on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(admiringly)Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you.\n\nAzula: From the inside we're in the perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li, controls Ba Sing Se.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all of the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras.\n\nAang:(rubbing an eye)What are chakras?\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basic. The water flows through this creek much like the energy flows through your body. As you see there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our charkas.",

"Aang: So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?\n\nGuru Pathik:(pleased)Exactly! If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek, and then what happens?",

"Aang: The creek can't flow?\n\nGuru Pathik:(nods)Yes. But if we open the paths between the pools...\n\nAang: The energy flows!\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: You cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready?\n\nAang:(pauses momentarily)I'll do whatever it takes.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: First we will open the Earth chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival and is blocked by fear.\n\nGuru Pathik:(in voice-over)What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek.\n\nGuru Pathik:You have opened your Earth chakra.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: Next is the...\n\nAang: Water chakra?\n\nGuru Pathik: Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a Guru too. This chakra deals with pleasure, and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt which burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for?",

"Aang:(sadly)I hurt all of those people.\n\nGuru Pathik: Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself.\n\n",

"Hakoda: This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through.\n\nBato: Your father invented tangle mines himself.(pours liquid into the cap of the spherical mine)\n\n",

"Sokka:(laughing hysterically)Ha ha! Good one Dad!\n\nBato:(rolling his eyes)You are definitely your father's son.\n\n",

"Water Tribe Soldier:(urgently)Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four fire nation ships.(the other tribesmen gather round)\n\nHakoda: Bato, get these mines loaded up. The rest of you men, prepare for battle!(the warriors rush off, as Sokka sits and watches them leave)",

"Sokka:(uncertain)Uh, what should I do, Dad?\n\nHakoda: Aren't you listening? I said the rest of you men get ready for battle.\n\n",

"Iroh: Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop. Follow your passion Zuko, and life will reward you.\n\nZuko:(cheerfully)Congratulations Uncle.\n\n",

"Iroh:(smiling)I'm very thankful.\n\nZuko:(confidently)You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.\n\n",

"Iroh: No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.(puts a hand on Zuko's arm)It means more than you know.(Zuko gives him a warm hug, to his surprise)\n\nZuko:(enthusiastically)Now let's make these people some tea.\n\n",

"Iroh:(eagerly)Yes! Let's make some tea!\n\nGuru Pathik: Third is the Fire chakra, located in the stomach.\n\n",

"Aang: My Fire chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.\n\nGuru Pathik: He he. Good one. Moving on. This chakra deals with will power and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?\n\n",

"Aang:(softly)I'm never going to fire bend again. I can't.\n\nGuru Pathik: You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar, and therefore, you are a firebender.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik:Hmm, that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a burping bison.\n\nAang:(belching loudly)Urrp! Tastes like onion and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?\n\n",

"Mai:(morosely)I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone can fight in this.\n\nTy Lee: Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.(The hidden Dai Li listen intently)\n\n",

"Mai: How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm gonna throw up.\n\nTy Lee: Princess Azula promised we would go back to the Fire Nation as soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient.\n\n",

"Mai:(anxious)Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?(stands to face Ty Lee)\n\nTy Lee: Sorry.\n\n",

"Azula: Good work girls.(glances up toward the roof)I am sure the Dai Li will deliver the message.\n\nGuru Pathik: The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love, and is blocked by grief. Lay all your grief out in front of you.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik:(voice-over)You have indeed felt a great loss. But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. The Air Nomads love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.",

"Aang: Can I have some onion banana juice please?\n\nGuru Pathik: The fifth in the chain is the Sound chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth, and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves.\n\n",

"Katara: Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?(The scene shifts back to the sitting Aang)\n\nAang: Because I never wanted to be.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar.\n\nGuru Pathik:Verygood Aang. You have opened the chakra of Truth.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: The sixth pool of energy is the Light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation.",

"Guru Pathik: Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided.\n\nAang: We're all connected.(opens his eyes)Everything is connected.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: That's right. Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion.\n\nGuru Pathik: If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of Earth,that has been purified and refined.",

"Toph:(straining) Come on metal.... budge.\n\nToph: Whoo! Toph, you rule!(does a double fisted strike at the wall)\n\n",

"Katara: What do you say Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?(steps inside the entrance)Table for two please.\n\nZuko: Uncle, I need two jasmine, one green and one lychee!\n\nIroh:(smiling)I'm brewing as fast as I can!",

"Aang: This is the last chakra isn't it?\n\nGuru Pathik: Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able go in and out of the Avatar State at will. And when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions.\n\n",

"Aang:(confident)Let's do this.\n\nGuru Pathik: The Thought chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik: Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river. Forgotten.\n\nAang:(startled)What? Why would I let go of Katara? I...I..I love her.\n\n",

"Pathik: Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.\n\nAang: Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago, that was a good thing.\n\n",

"Katara: Thank goodness you are here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city. I just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle! (Azula's eyes snap open at this news, and she smiles) We have to tell the Earth King right away!\n\n",

"Azula:(rising to her feet)Oh, don't worry. I'll be sure to let him know.\n\nAzula: So, Zuzu's in the city too. I think it's time for a family reunion.\n\n",

"Aang: I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.\n\n\n\n",

"Guru Pathik:(calmly)Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must openallthe chakras. Surrender yourself.\n\nAang: (reluctantly) Okay, I'll try.\n\n",

"Guru Pathik:(voice-over)Now, think of your attachments and let them go.\n\nGuru Pathik:(voice-over)Let the pure cosmic energy flow.\n\n",

"Master Yu: It's another one of her tricks!\n\nXin Fu:(incensed)There's a giant hole in the box. How's that a trick?\n\n",

"Toph: It's not! It's the real deal!\n\nToph:(triumphantly)I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!\n\n",

"Xin Fu:(dolefully)I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?\n\nMaster Yu:(pathetically)I have to go to the bathroom.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?\n\nSokka:(earnestly)You don't know how much this means to me dad. I'll make you proud, and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.\n\n",

"Hakoda:(reassuringly)Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me.(places a hand on his shoulder)I'm already proud of you, and I've always known you were a great warrior.\n\nSokka: Really?\n\n",

"Hakoda: Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?\n\nSokka:(apprehensively)This can't be good news.\n\n",

"Azula:(stops struggling)What do you want?\n\nLong Feng: I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se. And you have something I need.\n\n",

"Azula:(warily)Why should I help you?\n\nLong Feng: Because I can get you the Avatar.\n\nAzula: I'm listening.(both smile wickedly)\n\n",

"Messenger: A message from the royal palace.\n\nIroh:(overcome)I...I can't believe it.\n\nZuko:(walking over)What is it Uncle?\n\n",

























"Aang:(worried)I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.\n\nSokka: It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.\n\n",





"Azula: The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.",

"Azula: The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King, and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you inmecommand while we overthrow the government.",

"Azula: If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out. That is all.\n\nTy Lee: Nice speech Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way.\n\n",



"Mai: Yeah, I thought you were gonna make that one guy pee his pants.\n\nAzula: There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and Uncle.\n\n",

"Iroh: Many times, I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror...instead, we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.\n\nZuko:(cheerfully)It sure is Uncle.\n\n",

"Toph: So how did it go with the Guru? Did you master the Avatar State?\n\nGuru Pathik: If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!\n\n",

"Sokka: Aang, are you ok?\n\nAang:(smiling sheepishly)I'm great. It went great with the Guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. Heh heh...heh. Yeah.\n\n",

"Zuko: What's taking so long?\n\nIroh: Maybe the Earth King overslept.\n\n",

"Zuko: Something's not right.\n\nAzula:(mockingly)It's tea time.\n\n",

"Zuko:(standing to his feet)Azula!\n\nAzula: Have you met the Dai Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that is so Firebender, I just love it!\n\n",

"Iroh: Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname the \"Dragon of the West\"?\n\nAzula:(examining her nails and speaking in a bored tone)I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle.\n\n",

"Iroh: It's more of a demonstration really.\n\nIroh: Come on. You'll be fine.\n\n",

"Zuko: No. I'm tired of running. It's time I faced Azula!\n\nAzula: You're so dramatic. What, are you going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai?\n\n",

"Zuko:(angry and determined)Yes! I challenge you!\n\nAzula:(smiling mockingly)No thanks.\n\n",

"Earth King: Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about.\n\nAang: But, in my vision. I felt so sure that she was in trouble.\n\n",

"Earth King: Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion. And since then she's been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.\n\nSokka: See Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now, talking about make up or something.",

"Aang: Ok, maybe you're right.\n\nEarth King: Believe me, if there wasanydanger at all, Bosco's animal instinct would sense it.\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent: You've got company.\n\nKatara:(surprised)Zuko!\n\n",

"Aang: Momo!\n\nToph: There's no one else here.\n\n",

"Aang: Kataraisin trouble! I knew it!\n\nSokka: Oh no.\n\n",

"Toph: Wait, someone's at the door.(points back at the door. A moment later, someone knocks on it.)Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.(Toph walks to the door and slides it open to reveal Iroh.)Glad to see you're okay.\n\nIroh: I need your help.\n\n",

"Aang and Sokka: Huh uh !\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Aang:(shocked)You guys know each other!\n\nToph: I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Then he gave me tea and very good advice.\n\n",

"Iroh: May I come in?(Toph nods to him and he enters the room.)Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.\n\nAang: She must have Katara.\n\n",

"Iroh: She has captured my nephew as well.\n\nAang: Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.\n\n",

"Sokka: Woah there. You lost me at, \"Zuko\".\n\nIroh: I know how you must feel about my nephew. But believe me when I tell you there is good inside him.(places his hands on Sokka's shoulders in a pleading way)\n\n",

"Sokka: Good inside of him isn't enough. Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?\n\nAang: Katara is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.\n\n",

"Iroh: I brought someone along who might be able to help us.\n\nScared Dai Li Agent: Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup. They're going to overthrow the Earth King.\n\n",

"Sokka:(angrily)My sister! Where are they keeping Katara?(points his machete at the Dai Li agent)\n\nScared Dai Li Agent: In the crystal catacombs of old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.\n\n",

"Dai Li Agent: The movements of all the generals and the Earth King have been plotted out step by step.\n\nLong Feng: Good. And the Fire Nation Princess is cooperating?\n\n",

"Katara:(growing angrier)I don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through. Me personally(turns her back to Zuko and crouches down).The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.\n\nZuko: I'm sorry. That's something we have in common.\n\n",

"Toph: Well whaddya know. Thereisan ancient city down there, but it's deep.\n\nSokka: We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk...no offense.\n\n",

"Iroh: None taken.\n\nSokka: And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup.\n\n",

"Aang: So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice. And great tea.\n\nIroh: The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?\n\n",

"Aang: Well, I met with this Guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State, and control this great power. But to do it, I had to let go of someone I love, and I just couldn't.\n\nIroh: Perfection and power are overrated.",

"Iroh: I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.\n\nAang: What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I am not powerful enough?\n\n",

"Iroh: I don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving...\n\nIroh: You will come to a better place.",

"Sokka: The coup is happening right now! We've got to warn the Earth King!\n\nSokka: Thank goodness we're in time!\n\n",

"The Earth King: In time for what?\n\nTy Lee: Yeah, what are you in time for...(somersaults forward and lands in front of Sokka, putting her face close to his)cutie?\n\n",

"Sokka:(sweating)Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.\n\nTy Lee: Who?\n\n",

"Toph: They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!\n\nMai: Sorry to disappoint you.\n\n",

"Ty Lee: Ooo, it's like we're dancing together.\n\nAzula:This fight... is over.\n\n",

"Azula: Get them all out of my sight.\n\nLong Feng: Now comes the part where I double-cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation Princess. I said, arrest her. What is wrong with you?!\n\n",

"Azula: It's because they haven't made up their minds. They're waiting to see how this is going to end.\n\nLong Feng: What are you talking about?\n\n",

"Azula:Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player.",

"Zuko: It doesn't matter.\n\nKatara: It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.\n\n",

"Zuko: My face. I see(turns away and places a hand to his scar).\n\nKatara:(regretfully)No, no, that's not what I meant.\n\n",

"Zuko: It's ok. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.\n\nKatara: Maybe you could be free of it.",

"Zuko: What?\n\nKatara: I have healing abilities.\n\n",

"Zuko: It's a scar. It can't be healed.\n\nKatara: This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I have be saving it forsomething important.(walks up to Zukoand faces him)I don't know if it would work, but...\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, I knew you would come.\n\nZuko:(upset)Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar!!(points a finger at Aang)\n\n",

"Aang: Saving you, that's what.\n\nIroh: Zuko, it's time we talked.(turns to Aang and Katara)Go help your other friends. We'll catch up with you.\n\n",

"Zuko:(hurt)Why Uncle?\n\nIroh: You are not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good!\n\n",

"Azula: I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko...you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?\n\nZuko: Release him immediately!\n\n",

"Azula:It's not too late for you Zuko. You can still redeem yourself.\n\nIroh:The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.\n\n",

"Azula: Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? I need you Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day. This glorious day in Fire Nation history. And the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have your father's love",

"Iroh: Zuko, I am begging you, look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.\n\n",

"Toph: See any Dai Li agents near by?\n\nSokka: Nope. All clear.\n\n",

"Sokka: Let's go!\n\nEarth King: I'm not leaving without Bosco!\n\n",

"Katara: I thought you had changed!\n\nZuko: I have changed.\n\n",




"Aang: There's too many.\n\nGuru Pathik:(in Aang's memory)The only way, is to let her go.\n\n",

"Aang:(sadly)I 'm sorry Katara.\n\nIroh: You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can!\n\n",

"Azula: We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.\n\nZuko:(regretfully)I betrayed Uncle.\n\n",

"Azula: No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return home, father will welcome you as a war hero.\n\nZuko: But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?\n\n",

"Azula: He doesn't need to Zuko. Today, you restored your own honor.\n\nEarth King:(hopelessly)The Earth Kingdom... has fallen.\n\n",




"Aang:(confused)Momo?\n\nToph:(off screen)Twinkle-Toes, that's got to be you.\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, you're awake!\n\nAang:Are you sure?(rubs his eyes)I feel like I'm dreaming.(Aang is caught off guard when Katara runs up and embraces him.)\n\n",

"Katara:You're not dreaming. You're finally awake.(Katara lets go and the person dressed as a Fire Nation soldier walks up to Aang and gives him a quick hug.)\n\nSokka:Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy.\n\n",

"Aang:(confused)Sokka?\n\nToph:Uh-oh! Somebody catch him, he's gonna...\n\n",

"Aang:Ughh.\n\nMai:(walking onscreen)Aren't you cold?\n\n",

"Zuko:I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long. Over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how I've changed.\n\nMai:(sighs)I just asked if you were cold. I didn't ask for your whole life story.Stop worrying.\n\n",

"Aang:(off screen)Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one out of it?\n\nKatara:You need to take it easy, o.k? You got hurt pretty bad. I like your hair.\n\n",

"Aang:(shocked and feeling his scalp)I have hair? How long was I out?\n\nKatara:A few weeks.\n\n",

"Hakoda:Everything ok?\n\nKatara:(looking away)We're fine, Dad.\n\n",

"Hakoda:(offering Aang his hand)I'm Hakoda, Katara and Sokka's father.\n\nKatara:(annoyed)He knows who you are. I just called you \"Dad\", didn't I?\n\n",

"Hakoda:I guess you're right.\n\nAang:Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda(offers his hand).\n\n",

"Hakoda:(grabs Aang's arm)It's an honor to meet you.\n\nKatara:(annoyed)Great, great. Now you guys have finally met, so would you mind giving us a little privacy?\n\n",

"Hakoda:Of course.\n\nAang:Are you mad at your dad or something?\n\n",

"Katara:What? Not at all, why would you say that?\n\nAang:Mmm-emmm(shrugs, but almost immediately groans and holds his side in pain).\n\n",

"Katara:Maybe we should go upstairs. You need a healing session.\n\nKatara: Tell me where your pain feels most intense.(Aang's eyes are squeezed shut and he gives a soft grunt of pain.)\n\n",

"Aang:A little higher.\n\nAang:Wow, you are definitely in the right area there.\n\n",

"Katara:I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Let me just see if I can...\n\nAang:I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone. But you brought me back.\n\n",

"Katara:I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did, exactly.\n\nAang:You saved me.\n\n",






"Li and Lo:(voice over)Azula's agents quickly overtook the entire city. They went to Ba Sing Se's Great Walls, and brought them down!\n\nLo and Li:(voice over)The armies of the Fire Nation surged through the wall and swarmed over Ba Sing Se, securing our victory.\n\n",

"Li and Lo:Now the heroes have returned home. Your princess, Azula!\n\nLi and Lo:And after three long years, your prince has returned. Zuko!\n\n",

"Sokka:After what happened in Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety.\n\nSokka:(voice over)We flew back to  Chameleon Bay, where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.\n\n",

"Sokka:(voice over)The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone.\n\nSokka:(voice over)Well, not completely alone.\n\n",


"Aang:So, what now?\n\nHakoda:We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.\n\n",

"Katara:(annoyed)It's Sokka's invasion plan.\n\nHakoda:Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable.\n\n",

"Sokka:So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.\n\nPipsqueak:Good to see you again, Aang.\n\n",

"Sokka:And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage.(whispering)We have a secret(looks left and right).You!\n\nAang:Me?\n\n",

"Sokka:Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead!(stands up and raises his arms triumphantly)Isn't that great?!\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Aang:The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!\n\nSokka: No, it's great. It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore. And even better, they won't expect you on The Day of Black Sun.\n\n",

"Aang:No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!\n\nAang:I'll handle this. The Avatar is back!\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, wait. Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation.\n\nHakoda:Everyone just stay calm. Bato and I will take care of this.\n\n",

"Aang:(whispering)I hate not being able to do anything.\n\nToph:Hopefully, you won't need to.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Officer:Commander, why are you off course? All Western Fleet ships are supposed to be moving toward Ba Sing Se to support the occupation.\n\nHakoda:Actually, we're from the Eastern Fleet. We have orders to deliver some cargo.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Officer:Ah, Eastern Fleet. Well, nice of Admiral Chan to let us know he was sending one of his ships our way.\n\nBato:I am sure Admiral Chan meant no disrespect, sir.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Officer:I mean, how hard is it to write a quick note and send a hawk our way?\n\nHakoda: Next time, we'll send two hawks to be sure you get the message.\n\n",


"Toph:They know!\n\nAzula:You seem so downcast. Has Mai gotten to you already? Though actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately.\n\n",

"Zuko:I haven't seen Dad yet. I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished.\n\nAzula:So what?\n\n",

"Zuko:So, I didn't capture the Avatar.\n\nAzula:(gesturing)Who cares? The Avatar's dead. Unless you think he somehow miraculously survived.\n\n",

"Katara:This is water from the Spirit Oasis, at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important.\n\nZuko:No. There's no way he could've survived.\n\n",

"Azula:Well, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.\n\nToph:Load the Toph!\n\n",

"Katara:I'm gonna give us some cover!\n\nAang:I can't just stand by and do nothing!(Aang rushes outside.)\n\n",

"Sokka:Aang! No!\n\nSokka:You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret. Just let us handle this.\n\n",

"Aang:Fine!\n\nToph:How we doing?\n\n",

"Toph:(sarcastically)Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in.\n\nSokka:Hey! We're inenemyterritory. Those areenemybirds.\n\n",



"Sokka: (to Momo)Looks like we got out voted, sport.(To the kids)Let's get some new clothes.\n\nAang:I don't know about this. These clothes belong to somebody.\n\n",

"Katara:I call the silk robe!(She leaps from the rocks, runs to her prize and snatches it from the line.)\n\nAang:But if it's essential to our survival...then I call the suit!\n\n",



"Toph:Hmm...I should probably wear shoes, but then I won't be able to see as well. Sorry shoes! Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender.\n\n",

"Katara:(partially visible in the right side of the screen, from behind)How do I look?\n\nAang:Uh...your mom's necklace.\n\nKatara:(chagrined)Oh...oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously water tribe, isn't it?\n\n",


"Sokka:Come on, Aang. Every one here eats meat...even the meat!\n\n",

"Aang:(unconvinced)You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage.\n\nAang:Hotman. Hotman.Hotman. Hotman.Hotman.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Officer:It's over, we caught you.\n\nAang:Who me?\n\n",

":Who me?\n\nFire Nation Officer:It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here.(Aang cringes, expecting the worst.)Next time you play hooky, you might want to take off your school uniform.\n\n",

"Aang:Heh, heh. Uh!\n\nTeacher (Ms. Kwan):Oh! Is this a new mind ready for molding?\n\n",

"Aang:That's right.(He knocks himself on the head to indicate its lack of contents.)Let the molding begin.\n\nMs. Kwan: Wait a minute.(The officers stop and turn around.)You're not from the Fire Nation! Clearly you're from the colonies.\n\n",

"Aang:(relieved)Yeah, the colonies. Of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom.\n\nMs. Kwan:Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, webowto our elders. Like so.\n\n",

"Aang:Sorry ma'am.\n\nMs. Kwan:(tapping his head with her ferrule)And we don't wear head coverings indoors.\n\n",

"Aang: Um, I have a scar. It'sreallyembarrassing.\n\nMs. Kwan:Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you, \"Mannerless Colony Slob\"?\n\n",

"Aang:(chuckling)Just \"Slob\" is fine.(This doesn't go over well. He tries a different tack.)Or, uh... Kuzon.\n\nAang: We made it through the day, Momo. And...it was pretty fun!\n\n",

"On Ji:(from behind him)Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey.\n\nAang:(concealing Momo and turning around with an innocent grin on his face)What monkey?\n\n",

"On Ji:Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way.\n\nHide:(contemptuously)On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid.\n\n",




"Aang:It was nice meeting you.\n\nSmall Fire Nation Boy (Shoji):(approaching Aang)I don't believe it. He didn't beat you up. Not even a little.\n\n",

"Aang:(modestly)I guess I'm just lucky.\n\nShoji:We were on our way to play hide-and-explode. You wanna come?\n\n",

"Aang:I'd love to!\n\nKatara:Where have you been? We've been worried sick!\n\n",

"Aang:(covered in burn marks)I got invited to play with some kids after school.\n\nSokka:(standing up, flummoxed)Afterwhat?\n\n",

"Aang:(happily)I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.\n\nSokka:Enrolled inwhat?!\n\n",



"Sokka:Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea. But it sounds...really terrible.\n\nToph:Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go toschoolfor?\n\n",

"Aang:Every minute I'm in that classroom. I'm learning new things about the fire nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.\n\nSokka:Impressive, I admit. But I still think it's too dangerous.\n\n",

"Aang:(deviously)I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We weresupposedto learn about it in class tomorrow...\n\nSokka:Hmm... Iama fan of secret rivers.(relenting)Fine, let's stay a few more days.\n\n",

"Aang:Flamey-o, Hotman!(He runs off in excitement.)\n\nSokka:(turning to Katara)Flamey-o??\n\n",


"Ms. Kwan:Good morning, class. Recite the Fire Nation oath.\n\nStudents:My life, I give to my country. With my hands, I fight for Fire Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him...\n\n",

"Aang:Fire Lord...forefathers...\n\nStudents:With my mind, I seek ways to better my country, and with my feet...\n\n",

"Aang:(desperately)Firebenders...Fire Lord...blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nMs. Kwan: Since it's obviously hilarious to mock our national oath, we'll begin with a pop quiz on our Great March of Civilization.\n\n",

"Ms. Kwan:Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air Nation Army?(Aang raises his hand. She acknowledges him suspiciously.)Kuzon?\n\nAang:(rising)Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.\n\n",

"Ms. Kwan: (flustered) Well, I don't know how you could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago.\n\nAang:(thinking better of it and sitting down)I'll just write down my best guess.\n\n",

"Music Teacher:Kuzon?\n\nAang:(stops playing)I know. I'm a terrible Tsungi hornist.\n\n",

"Music Teacher:No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that a nervous disorder?\n\nAang:I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?\n\n",

"Shoji: (sitting beside him)Not really, no.\n\nMusic Teacher: (walking to the window)Dancing is not conducive to a proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and order.\n\n",






"On Ji:(approaching him)Oh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance you were doing.\n\nAang:Thanks, On Ji. I could show it to you again, if you'd like.\n\n",

"Hide:What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something?(He approaches them.)\n\nAang:Just some dance movements.\n\n",


"School Headmaster:Picking fights on your second day? We need to have a conference to discuss your punishment. Bring your parents to my office after school.\n\nAang:Parents? But...\n\n",

"School Headmaster: Thank you for coming, Mr. And Mrs...\n\nSokka:Fire! Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire.\n\n",







"Mai:(referring to the sunset) Orange is such an awful color.\n\nZuko:(snickering) You're so beautiful when you hate the world.\n\n",

"Mai: I don't hate you.\n\nZuko: I don't hate you, too. \n\n(They kiss.)\n\n",

"Azula:(off-screen) Ahem! (The two lovers look up at her in irritation.) Zuko, could I have a word with you?\n\nZuko:Can't you see we're busy? (He and Mai resume their \"business\".)\n\n",





















"Azula:(not to be put off)Oh, Mai... Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid.\n\nMai:(complaisantly)Sounds pretty serious.(She gets up and leaves. Walking past Azula, towards the camera, she shoots the princess a quick, poisonous glance behind her back.)\n\n",

"Azula:So...I hear you've been to visit your Uncle Fatso in the\n\nZuko:(standing, incensed)That guard told you.\n\n",

"Azula:(smugly)No, you did. Just now.\n\nZuko:(sitting back down)Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?\n\n",

"Azula:(solicitiously) Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just becareful, dum-dum.\n\nSokka:That settles it. No more school for you young man!\n\n",

"Aang:I'm not ready to leave. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time.\n\nToph:(mockingly)Ha, ha.\n\n",

"Aang:Listen, guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we wanna change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.\n\nSokka:What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?\n\n",

"Aang:I'm gonna throw them...(he does a quick tap dance flourish...a secret dance party!\n\nSokka :(pointing)Go to your room!\n\n",

"Act III\n\nSokka:(arranging candles)I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so... silly.\n\n",

"Aang:Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork.\n\nToph:They're coming! Everyone stop bending!\n\n",

"Aang:(approaching Appa)Sorry, buddy. You should probably wait out back. I know, you've got fancier feet than anybody...and six of 'em!\n\nAang:Ladies and gentlemen, The Flamey-os! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving.\n\n",

"Shoji:Now what do we do?\n\nAang:This is when you start dancing.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Boy 1:(as his head disappears into his collar like a turtle's into its shell)I don't think my parents want me dancing in a cave.\n\nFire Nation Boy 2:Yeah, what if someone finds out?(He looks around anxiously and scuttles off-screen.)\n\n",

"Aang:Oh, boy. Listen, guys...dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.\n\nShoji:Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon. But we don't do that here.\n\n",

"Aang:Sure you do. You have for generations. It just so happens that I know several classic fire nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as \"The Phoenix Flight.\"\n\nAang:And this was the \"Camelephant Strut\".\n\n",

"Toph:Who knew Twinkletoes could dance? (Katara smiles)\n\n",

"Zuko:I brought you some komodo-chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it. I have everything I always wanted, but it's not at all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice.\n\n",

"Zuko: I think the Avatar is still alive. I know he's out there. I'm losing my mind.(desperately)Please, Uncle, I'm so confused! I need your help.(Iroh is motionless. Zuko stands, enraged.)Forget it! I'll solve this myself! Waste away in here for all I care!\n\n",

"Aang:And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.\n\nSokka:Wow, they look pretty good together.\n\n",

"Katara:(dismissively, looking away)Eh, if that's what you like.\n\n:(dismissively, looking away)Eh, if that's what you like.\n\n",

"Aang:Yeah, that's it. That's the sound of happy feet. All right, go with that. Everybody freestyle!\n\nKatara:I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I'm not sure that I know how to...\n\nAang:(masterfully)Take my hand.\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, everyone's watching.\n\nAang:Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now.\n\n",

"Headmaster:He's the one we want.(Aang looks up, alarmed.)The boy with the headband!\n\nAang:Uh-oh.\n\n",

"Katara: We're safe, Sokka. You can take off the moustache, now.\n\nSokka:(smugly)Oh, no, I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin.(He strokes it, unaccountably pleased with himself.)\n\n",

"Toph:Way to go, Dancypants. I think you really did help those kids. You taught them to be free.\n\nAang:I don't know. It was just a dance party, that's all.\n\nKatara:Well, that was some dance party, Aang.\n\n",

"Zuko:You're sure you weren't followed? I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do. And even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar's alive. I want you to find him.(Cut to a close-up of Zuko's face.)And end him.\n\n",

"Act I\n\nAang:(playing hide-and-go-seek)Momo!(He ducks underwater before Momo sees him, resurfacing nearby.)Oh Momo!(He ducks again, surfaces again, and the lemur finally spots him.)Ah! Ha ha, you found me, buddy.\n\n",

"Sokka: Well, that explains why I can't catch a fish around here. Because  my fishing skills are... off the hook! Get it? Like a fishing hook?\n\nToph:Too bad your skills aren'tonthe hook.(Toph's sally is more successful; everyone laugh, except Sokka, who scowls.)",

"Katara:It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food.(A long scroll of paper unrolls in front of her.)Assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule.\n\nSokka:Hm...it's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today!\n\n",

"Aang:Hey, maybe we can get food there.\n\nAang:Now you look just like a little hill with horns. Bye buddy!\n\n",

"Toph:I don't feel anything. Where is this village?\n\nSokka:It's in the middle of the river!\n\n",

"Dock:Sure is!(Pan down to reveal the village eccentric in his boat.)My name's Dock. Mind if I ask who you are?\n\nKatara:We're, um, from the Earth Kingdom colonies.\n\n",

"Dock:Wow... colonials! Hop on; I'll give you a ride into town.\n\nKatara:Why do you guys live on the river?\n\n",

"Katara:Look at this place. It's so sad. We have to do something to help.\n\nSokka: No, we can't waste our time here! We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own!\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic! We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord!\n\n",

"Toph:(slapping her hand over Sokka's mouth)Hey, loudmouth! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about taking out the Fire Lord.\n\n", 

"Sokka:(a little quieter)Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey, Dock. You work here too?\n\nDock:I'm not Dock, I'm Xu. Dock's my brother.\n\nAang:But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. The only difference is your hat.\n\nDock: Dock works in another place\n\nAang: I don't get it.\n\nDock:Me neither.",

"Sokka:We'll just take the fish. Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?\n\nDock:Hey, colonials. My brother says you need a lift.\n\n",

"Boy:Can you spare some food?\n\nKatara:(sadly, giving him a fish)I wish I could spare more.\n\n",

"Sokka:Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.\n\nToph: (sarcastically)Finagle away, O schedule master.\n\n",

"Sokka:Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.\n\nKatara: Forty-threeminutes?\n\n",

"Sokka:Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse - which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!",

"Toph: Well, I'mn ot waking up early.\n\nSokka:Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.\n\nAang:What?\n\nKatara:No way.\n\nToph:Forget it.\n\n",

"Sokka:I got it, how's this From now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at thesame time.\n\nGang:Ew.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.\n\nAang:What's the matter, Katara?\n\n",

"Katara:I think Appa's sick.\n\nSokka:What, Appa's sick? That's awful!\n\n",

"Toph:Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.\n\nSokka:Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.\n\n",


"Toph:He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.\n\nAang:He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy?(He pulls Appa's tongue out.)His tongue is purple! Thatcan'tbe good. Katara, can you heal him?\n\n",

"Katara:It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.\n\nToph: Is it just me, or does this place seem different?\n\n",

"Aang:Yeah, are the people...happier?\n\nSokka:Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?\n\n",

"Dock:Ah, something amazing happened last night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person...the Painted Lady.\n\nKatara:The Painted who now?\n\n",

"Dock: The Painted Lady. She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a legend. Until now.\n\nSokka:See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them",

"Dock:Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so many sick people in our village.\n\nKatara: Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.\n\n",

"Sokka: (mulling it over briefly) Two-headed! (The kids are revolted.) What? You get more for your money that way.\n\nBoy:Thank you, Painted Lady.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?\n\nDock:Let me check...(He runs around the shop and ducks beneath the counter to switch hats.)Hey there! Back again, are ya?\n\nToph:We need more food. Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.\n\n",

"Dock:Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend.\n\nSokka:(the eternal skeptic)And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.\n\n",

"Dock:(oblivious to sarcasm)Yeah, may be! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks.\n\nAang:Is that why this place seems so festive?\n\n",

"Dock: Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady.\n\nKatara:Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady? I mean... spirit?\n\n",

"Sokka:Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.\n\nKatara:(indignantly)Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.\n\n",

"Sokka:Yeah,now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.(He makes gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic.)Oooooo... pow.\n\n",

"Aang:Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like...(He does an elaborate dance to one-up Sokka) Woooooo....\n\n",

"Aang and Sokka:Wooooooo.....\n\nAang:What's the matter, buddy?(He spots Katara just as she is slipping out of sight.)It's her!(He runs after her.)Hello, Painted Lady spirit!(Katara, shocked, begins running away)\n\n",

"Aang: My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar.\n\nKatara: (in a ridiculous fake voice, and attempting to hide her face)Well, hello, Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.\n\n",

"Aang:Yeah, me too. I hate that.(He takes a peek under her hat brim.)You know, you're really pretty for a spirit. I don't get to meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet...not very attractive.\n\nKatara: (chuckling nervously)Thank you, but...\n\n",

"Aang:(suspiciously)You seem familiar, too.\n\nKatara:A lot of people say that.\n\n",

"Aang:No...youreallyseem familiar.\n\nKatara:Look, I really should get going...\n\n",

"Aang:Katara !\n\nKatara:(defeated)Hi, Aang.\n\n",

"Aang:You'rethe Painted Lady ! But how?\n\nKatara: I wasn't at first, I was just trying to help the village. But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway...I guess I just kind of became her.\n\n",

"Aang:So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait...is Appa even sick\n\nKatara:He...might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but, other than that, he's fine.\n\n",

"Aang:I can't believe you lied to everyone so you could help these people.\n\nKatara:I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have.\n\n",

"Aang: No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero.\n\nKatara:Well, if you want to help...there's one more thing I have to do.\n\n",

"Aang:You want to destroy this factory?\n\nKatara: Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently.\n\n",

"Aang: Ha ha! \n\nKatara:Shhh, we don't want to wake Sokka.(It is a little late for this; Sokka and Toph are waiting for the pair as they walk into camp. Katara is all innocence.)Hi! Sokka! We were just...out on a...morning walk!\n\n",

"Sokka:Oh, really? A morning walk?(He dumps the dry grass from her sleeping bag onto the ground.)I know you're the Painted Lady. I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and feeding him purplizing tongue berries!",

"Toph:What's going on?\n\nAang: Fire Nation soldiers are heading to the village.\n\n",

"Sokka:(to Katara, angrily)What did you do?!\n\nKatara:(guiltily)I...kind of destroyed their factory.\n\n",

"Sokka: You what?!\n\nKatara: It was your idea!\n\n",

"Sokka:I was joking. I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises. Did you even think this through? The army's gonna blame the villagers. They're headed there right now to get revenge.\n\nKatara:Well, what was I supposed to do?\n\n",

"Sokka:Leave! Do nothing!\n\nKatara:(dramatic close-up)No. I will never,everturn my back on people who need me.(She gets up to leave.)I'm going down to the village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.\n\n",

"Sokka:Wait. I'm coming too.\n\nKatara:I thought you didn't want to help.\n\n",

"Sokka: You needme, and I will never turn my back onyou.\n\nKatara: Sokka. You reallydohave a heart.(They hug.)\n\n",

"Aang:(overcome)He really does have a heart, doesn't he?\n\nAct III\n\n",

"Katara:Leave this village and never come back.\n\nBoy:I knew you'd come.\n\n",

"Dock:Thank you!\n\nRandom Villager:Painted Lady, you're the best!\n\n",

"Dock:Me and my brothers really owe you a lot.(Looking at her, he has a shock of recognition.)Hey, wait a minute! I know you! You're not the Painted Lady, you're that colonial girl!\n\nBoy:Yeah, you're the lady that gave me a fish.\n\n",

"Dock:You've been tricking us. You're a waterbender!\n\nRandom Villager:She's a waterbender! How dare you act like our Painted Lady?\n\n",

"Sokka:Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her.\n\nKatara:Sokka, it's okay.",

"Katara: I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.\n\n",

"Dock:She's right, but what should we do?\n\nToph:Maybe we can clean the river.\n\n",

"Dock:Yeah, we can clean the river!(The crowd cheers this idea.)Thank you. You know, you're not so bad for a waterbender.\n\nSokka:You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?\n\n",

"Dock: No problem. Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother Xu, on the other hand, hoo! He's a blabbermouth.\n\nKatara:So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?\n\n",

"Dock: No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers. Alright, I'm Bushi! Let's get some river cleaning done.\n\nAang:Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop ownerandthe boat guy.\n\n",

"Dock:Oh, you must be talking about my brothers, Dock and Xu.\n\nAang:(exasperated)No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!\n\n",

"Dock:Oh, you know who does that? My brother Dock.(conspiratorial whisper)He's crazy.\n\nPainted Lady:Thank you.\n\n",

"Sokka's Master\n\nWritten By:Tim Hedrick\n\n",

"Sokka: Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.\n\nToph: Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it 1,000 times.\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh, man. You've nevernotseen anything like this.\n\nKatara: The fire is gonna destroy that town.\n\n",

"Aang: Not if we can stop it.\n\nKatara: There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water on to the fire.(Katara whips Appa's reigns and flies off.)\n\n",

"Aang: Toph, let's make a trench to keep the fire from coming any closer.\n\nSokka:(dejectedly)What should I do?\n\n",

"Aang: Keep an eye on Momo(Momo flies to Sokka and lands on his head.)\n\nSokka: So what, I'm just a lemur-sitter(petting Momo's head)There, there. Feel better?\n\n",

"Aang:(bending the water around)Sokka, stand clear.\n\nSokka:(disappointedly)Right, stand clear. Got it.\n\n",

"Aang:(dusting his hands off)Good work, everybody.\n\nWarden Poon:(descending)Look at you. You're just a fat, disgusting old man. You do nothing, you say nothing. You just eat and roll around in your own filth like a pig. You're a disgrace.\n\n",

"Aang: These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night.\n\nToph:(eating a dumpling)Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love.\n\n",

"Sokka:(off screen, sarcastically)Boo-hoo, poor heroes.\n\nKatara: What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.\n\n",

"Sokka: It's just...all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around, and making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, ok(sadly)I can't do anything.\n\nKatara: That's not true. No one can read a map like you.\n\n",

"Toph: I can't read at all.\n\nAang: Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time I mean, look at Katara's hair, right(grabs a lock of Katara's hair and gestures to it)What's up with that?\n\n",

"Katara:(embarrassed)What? What's wrong with my hair?(Katara looks left and right nervously, trying to cover her hair.)\n\nAang:(apologetic)Nothing, I was just trying to...\n\n",

"Sokka: Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you issoamazing andsospecial, and I'm not. I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.\n\nKatara: I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know none of us see you that way.",

"Sokka: Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling. Hey, how about these (begins twirling the nunchaku) Ho-ya! Smack-a-dacka-doo!\n\nAang:(off screen) What do you think? Pretty slick, huh? All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.\n\n",

"Katara:(shielding her eyes from the shine of the armor)What's a wind sword?\n\nAang: It's where I get a sword handle. And then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade.(Aang raises a sword handle a swings it around, making wind noises.)\n\n",

"Katara: Yeah...nice.\n\nAang: I'll just stick to what I got.\n\n",

"Sokka: Ooo. That's what Sokka's talking about.\n\nShop Keeper: You have a good eye. That's an original from Piandao, the greatest sword master and sword maker in Fire Nation history. He lives in the big castle up the road from here.\n\n",

"Aang: That's it. That's what you needed all along, Sokka.\n\nSokka: A sword?\n\n",

"Aang: Not the sword...a master. We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao.\n\nKatara: That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher.\n\n",

"Toph: I learned from badger moles. They don't talk, but they're still good teachers.\n\nSokka:(pulls out the sword and examines the blade)It would be nice to be a master swordfighter. All right, I'll talk to him.\n\n",

"Fat:(apathetic)Can I help you?\n\nSokka: I've come to train with The Master.\n\n",

"Fat: You should know The Master turns almost everyone away.(holds his hand out)What did you bring him to prove your worth?\n\nSokka: Well, uh...(feels around his clothes for something to offer)\n\n",

"Fat:Right.(shakes his head sadly)Let's get this over with.\n\nSokka: Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.\n\n",

"Piandao: Sokka. That's an unusual name.\n\nSokka:(nervously)Oh, uh, really? Uh, where I come from, The Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name, for Fire Nation colonials.\n\n",

"Piandao:  Let me guess. You've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town. And you think you deserve to learn from The Master.\n\nSokka: Well, actually, I've been all over the world.\n\n",

"Piandao:(knowingly)Yep, here we go.\n\nSokka: And I know one thing for sure,(gets down on his knees and hangs his head)I have a lot to learn.\n\n",

"Piandao:(glancing back)You're not doing a very good job of selling yourself.\n\nSokka: I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. But the truth is...I don't know if I am worthy.\n\n",

"Piandao: Hm, I see. Well, then,(smiles and picks up his sword)let's find out together how worthy you are.\n\nPiandao: Iwilltrain you.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nPiandao: The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself.(unsheathes his word and begins performing a sword form)You must think of it as another part of your own body.\n\n",

"Piandao: The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes the most versatile of weapons, and just as the imagination is limitless so too are the possibilities of the sword.\n\n",

"Aang: What should we do today?\n\nToph: I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice.\n\n",

"Aang: Twice?\n\nToph: The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for thesweetpicking sensation.\n\n",

"Katara: Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.\n\nToph:(picking her nose)Plus, it's so hot today.\n\n",

"Aang:(jokingly)How hot is it?\n\nToph: I don't know. Real hot?\n\n",

"Katara: It's so hot, it's so hot... Momo is shedding like Appa.(pets Momo and flicks tufts of fur from her fingers)Huh, huh?\n\nAang: I guess the jokes don't run in the family.\n\n",

"Katara: Oh, everyone's a critic.\n\nPiandao: The warrior practices a variety of arts tokeep his mind sharp and fluid.(flattens out a piece of paper on the table)The first\n\n",

"Sokka:(skeptical) Writing my name will make me a better swordsman?\n\nPiandao: When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield.",

"Piandao: You are getting ink on your face.\n\nSokka: I am?(looks at the brush)I am. So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?\n\n",

"Piandao: Landscape painting teaches a warrior to hold the lay of the land in his mind.\n\nPiandao: In battle, you only have an instant to take everything in.\n\n",

"Piandao: Now, paint it.\n\nPiandao: And no peeking.\n\n",

"Sokka: I'm finished.\n\nPiandao: You added a rainbow.\n\n",

"Sokka:(worried)Is that ok?\n\nPiandao: Sokka.\n\n",

"Piandao: Concentrate on what you're doing.\n\nPiandao: Rock gardening teaches the warrior to manipulate his surroundings and use them to his advantage.\n\n",

"Sokka: Hm, manipulate them to my advantage. Oh!\n\nSokka: Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for me?\n\n",

"Piandao: I'll take a slice of lemon in mine, please.\n\nWarden Poon: What's going on in there?\n\n",

"Warden Poon: Crazy old man.\n\nKatara: So where are we going next?(pointing to the map)We're starting from here.\n\n",

"Aang:(pointing at a different spot)No, we're over on this island.\n\nToph:(lying down)You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.\n\n",

"Katara: Ooh, I got one. If you miss him so much, why don't you marry him?\n\nPiandao: You've had a good first day of training.\n\n",

"Sokka: I have? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on.\n\nPiandao: You messed things up in a very special way. You are ready for a real sword.\n\n",

"Sokka:(excited)Are you giving me one of yours?\n\nPiandao: No.(Sokka groans disappointedly and slumps down.)\n\n",

"Piandao: Your sword must be an extension of yourself. So tomorrow, you will make your own sword.\n\nAct III \n\n",

"Piandao: Choosing the correct material is the most important step in crafting a sword. You must trust your steel with your life. Choose carefully.\n\nSokka: Master, would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword?\n\n",

"Piandao: I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nToph: Sokka's coming!\n\n",

"Sokka: Hey, guys. What are you doing?\n\nAang: Sokka!\n\n",

"Toph: You're back.\n\nKatara: We missed you so much.\n\n",

"Aang: Say something funny.\n\nSokka: Funny how?\n\n",

"Sokka: What's their deal?\n\nToph: I don't know. They missed you or something. I didn't care.(turns away, blushing and smiling)\n\n",

"Sokka: Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help.\n\nPiandao: Who's this?\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks.(Piandao bows to them)Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite?\n\nPiandao: We'll make a sword unlike any other in the world.\n\n",

"Piandao: Sokka, when you first arrived, you were so unsure. You even seemed down on yourself. But I saw something in you right away. I saw a heart as strong as a lion turtle, and twice as big. And as we trained, it wasn't your skills that impressed me.", 

"Piandao: No, it certainly wasn't your skills.(Sokka looks down in shame)You showed something beyond that.(unsheathes the sword, showing its black blade)Creativity, versatility, intelligence... these are the traits that define a great swordsman.",

"Piandao: And these are the traits that define you.(sheathes the sword, kneels and gives it to Sokka)You told me you didn't know if you were worthy, but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained.",

"Sokka: I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. I am not worthy. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe. I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry.\n\n",

"Piandao: I'm sorry, too.\n\nSokka: No, this is my fight, alone.\n\n",

"Warden Poon: You used to be the pride of The Fire Nation. Our top general. The Dragon of the West. Now, look at you. Look what you've become Iroh.",

"Piandao: (towards Sokka) Excellent! Using your superior agility against an older opponent...smart.\n\n",

"Piandao: Good use of terrain...fighting from the high ground.\n\nPiandao: Yes, use your surroundings. Make them fight for you!\n\nPiandao: Very resourceful.\n\nPiandao: Excellent work, Sokka.\n\n",

"Piandao: I think I'm a little old to be fighting the Avatar.\n\nAang: How did you know?\n\n",

"Piandao: Oh, I've been around a while. You pick things up.(wipes the dirt off his face with the cloth)Of course, I knew from the beginning\n\nKatara: But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe?\n\n",

"Piandao: The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation. Knowledge of the arts belongs to us all. Sokka, you must continue your training on your own.",

"Sokka: It's a Pai Sho tile.\n\nAang: The white lotus. Hm.\n\nKatara: What does it mean?\n\nSokka: I have no idea. Ooh, that reminds me. Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before.\n\n",

"Toph: Sweet. Check this out.\n\nKatara: You know, I don't think there's such a thing as \"space earth.\" If it's from space, then it's not really earth.\n\n",

"Sokka: Must you ruin everything?\n\nKatara: I can't believe I missed you.\n\n",

"Act I\n\nTy Lee:I'm so excited to spend the weekend on Ember Island. (Cut to a close shot of Azula and Ty Lee standing on the deck, with Zuko and Mai sitting in the shade nearby) It's gonna be great to hang out on the beach and do nothing.\n\n",

"Zuko:Doing nothing is a waste of time. (Zuko stands up)We're being sent away on a forced vacation. I feel like a child.\n\nAzula:Lighten up. So dad wants to meet with his advisors alone... without anyone else around. Don't take it personally.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(gestures at Azula)Doesn't your family have a house on Ember Island?\n\nAzula:(turns toward Ty Lee)We used to come every summer when we were kids.\n\n",

"Ty Lee: (enthused)That must've been fun!\n\nZuko:That was a long time ago.\n\n",

"Li and Lo:Welcome to Ember Island, kids.\n\nZuko:It smells like old lady in here.\n\n",

"Mai:(sarcastically, looking toward Zuko) Gee, I wonder why.\n\nTy Lee: Who are these two beautiful women?\n\n",

"Li and Lo:Can't you tell (The elderly twins strike the identical seductive pose from the painting.)It's Li/Lo and me.\n\nTy Lee:(snuggling against the pillow)Ooh, I love this seashell bedspread!\n\n",

"Mai:(Cut to shot of Mai)Are you serious? It looks like the beach threw up all over it.\n\nLi:We know you're upset that you were forced to come here this weekend. But Ember Island is a magical place. Keep an open mind. \n\n",

"Lo: (to Zuko) Give it a chance...\n\nLi and Lo: ...and it can help you understand yourselves and each other. The beach has a special way of smoothing even the most ragged edges. Time to hit the beach! \n\n",

"Toph:(voice over)Aang, I know swimming is fun and all, (wide shot of Toph, Katara, Sokka and Aang lounging around the water.)but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that(Close shot of Toph.)Cover up!\n\nAang: What? I'm wearing trunks.\n\n",

"Toph:I know...it's your tattoos(raises arms in frustration)I'm worried about. What if someone sees you?\n\nKatara:(turning toward Toph)There are walls all around us. It's completely safe.\n\n",



"Aang: (to Momo)Let's go again! \n\nFire Nation Officer 1:The Avatar's alive! We better send a messenger hawk to the Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Teen Boy 1: (eager)Hey, you need some help unpacking?\n\nTy Lee:Sure, thanks.\n\n",

"Zuko:Here...(Bringing the shell toward her)This is for you.\n\nMai:Why would I want that?\n\nZuko:I saw it and I thought it was pretty. Don't girls like stuff like this?\n\nMai: (turns away from him) Maybe stupid girls.\n\nZuko: Forget it!\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(Close Shot of Ty Lee taking the Shell)Wow, thanks. This is so pretty.\n\nFire Nation Teen Boy 2:(Back to shot of Fire Nation Teen 2 crouched in front of Fire Nation Teen)Not as pretty as you are.(Fire Nation Teen 1 looks angry)\n\n",

"Fire Nation Teen Boy 1:(Fire Nation Teen 1 moves to the side to get a closer look at the shell)That shell's not so great!\n\nTy Lee:(Cut to close shot of Ty Lee with sun in her eyes)Ahem, shade... shade!\n\n",

"Zuko:(Close shot of the two of them) I thought since it's so hot... Here.(He hands her an ice cream cone, but the scoop of ice cream falls off the cone into Mai's lap)\n\nMai: (She looks down at the ice cream)Thanks. This is really refreshing.\n\n",

"Azula: Hey, beach bums, we're playing next. Ty Lee, get over here now!\n\nAzula:See that girl with the silly pigtails? When she runs towards the ball, there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood\n\n",

"Azula: Yes, we defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation! Well, that was fun.\n\nChan:I'm having a party tonight.(Camera turns toward Ruon Jian and Chan)You should come by.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(turning toward them)Sure...I love parties!\n\nRuon Jian:(indicating Mai)Your friend can come, too.\n\nAzula:What about me and my brother? Aren't you going to invite us? You don't know who we are, do you?\n\n",

"Ruon Jian:Yeah.\n\nChan:(with a raised eyebrow)But fine, you're invited. Just so you know though, some of the most important teenagers in the Fire Nation are gonna be at this party so...try and act normal.\n\n",

"Azula:We'll do our best.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Zuko:Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?\n\nAzula:I guess I was intrigued.(Cut to shot of Azula sitting next to Ty Lee)I'm so used to people worshipping us.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:They should.\n\nAzula:Yes, I know, and I love it! But for once, I just wanted to see how people would treat us if they didn't know who we were.\n\n",

"Li and Lo: Like waves washing away the footprints on the sand, Ember Island gives everyone a clean slate. Ember Island reveals the true you. To the party!\n\nChan:Um... You're a little early. No one's here yet.\n\n",

"Azula:I heard you telling someone you'd be partying from dusk till dawn.(looks out at the horizon)It's dusk so we're here.\n\nChan:But that's just an expression.\n\n",

"Azula:We are the perfect party guests. We arrive right on time because we are very punctual.\n\nChan: All right, listen, My dad's an admiral. He has no idea I'm having this party, so don't mess anything up.\n\n",

"Azula:That's a sharp outfit, Chan...careful, you could puncture the hull of an Empire-Class Fire Nation Battleship, leaving thousands to drown at sea...because it's so sharp.\n\nChan:Um...(Chan points less enthusiastically at Azula) Thanks.\n\n",

"Ruon Jian:Hey, first ones here, huh?\n\nZuko:(cut to shot of Zuko and Mai walking side by side)Pft. He thinks he's so great.(to Mai)Well, what do you think of him?(they stop walking)\n\n",

"Mai:I don't have any opinion about him. I hardly know him.\n\nZuko:You like him, don't you?\n\n",

"Fire Nation Teen 2:So how do you know Ty Lee?\n\nFire Nation Teen 3:I met her at the beach today. She was pretty impressed by a sand pagoda that I made for her.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Teen 1:(bursts into the shot)Well, I met her first.\n\nTy  Lee:Look, it doesn't matter who I met first 'cause I like you all.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Teen 2:But which one of us do youlike?\n\nAll:Yeah. Tell us.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:I don't know, I don't know.\n\nTy Lee:Oh, I'm glad you're here. Those boys won't leave me alone. I guess they all just like me too much.\n\n",

"Azula:Come on, Ty Lee, you can't be this ignorant.\n\nTy Lee: (Close shot of Ty Lee, confused)What are you talking about?\n\n",

"Azula: Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are.(Cut to Ty Lee, bursting into tears. She covers her eyes)",

"Azula: Ok, ok, calm down. I didn't mean what I said.(Close shot of Azula)Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little...(whispers)jealous.\n\nTy Lee:(surprised)What? You were jealous of me?Um, but, you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world.",

"Azula:Well, you're right\n\nTy Lee: But you probably would do something horrible to them. I'm sure they're just intimidated by you. Ok, look, if you want a boy to like you just look at him and smile a lot and laugh at everything he says, even if it's not funny.",

"Azula:(Looks down)Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid.(Looks up grinning)Let's try it.\n\n Chan: Hey, there sweet sugar cakes.(points coolly toward Azula)How ya likin' this party?\n\nAzula:(laughs loud and unnaturally)",

"Mai:I'm bored.\n\nZuko:I know.\n\nMai:I'm hungry.\n\nZuko:So what?\n\nMai:So, find me some food.\n\nZuko:Sure. (gets up and walks away)\n\n",

"Azula:Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house.\n\nChan:Is this your first time on Ember Island?\n\nAzula:No, I used to come here years ago.\n\n",

"Chan: It's a great place if you like sand.(Azula forces and enthusiastic laugh)Yeah, it's like, \"Welcome to Sandy Land.\"\n\nAzula:Your arms look so strong.\n\n",

"Chan: Yeah, I know.(Flexes, and then kisses Azula. Cut to close shot of Chan.) You're pretty.\n\nAzula:Together, you and I will be the strongest couple in the world!\n\nChan:Uh... I gotta go.\n\n",

"Ruon Jian:Whoa. What are you doing?\n\nZuko:(close-up shot of Zuko, angry)Stop talking to my girlfriend!\n\n",

"Ruon Jian:(Ruon Jian approaches Zuko)Relax, it's just a party.(Zuko pushes Ruon Jian hard, sending him flying across the room, breaking a giant vase.)\n\nMai:(Mai stands up and grabs Zuko's shoulder. He turns towards her.)Zuko, what is wrong with you?!\n\n",

"Zuko:What's wrong with me?!\n\nMai:(angrily)Your temper's out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hot-headed and angry.\n\n",

"Zuko:Well, at least I feel something...as opposed to you. You have no passion for anything.(raising his arms is the air)You're just a big \"blah\".\n\nMai:(turning away from him)It's over, Zuko. We're done.\n\n",

"Chan:Who broke my Nana's vase?(Ruon Jian points at Zuko. Chan runs over to Zuko and gestures for him to leave immediately.)That's it, you're out of here.\n\nZuko:(close- up shot of Zuko)I was just leaving.\n\n",

"Ruon  Jian:Have fun by yourself,loserboy.\n\nChan:(Chan looks at Ruon Jian and smiles) Nice.\n\n",

"Act III\n\nToph:Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.\n\n",

"Azula:I thought I'd find you here.\n\nZuko:Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed.\n\n",

"Azula:(she gestures down the steps)Come down to the beach with me.(she starts down the steps)Come on, this place is depressing.\n\nMai: Hey...(Interrupted)\n\n",

"Zuko:(close shot of Zuko)Where's your new boyfriend?(Mai turns away angrily. Zuko comes and sits next to her)Are you cold?(he puts his arm around her, but she slaps it away)\n\nTy Lee:I'm freezing.\n\n",

"Zuko:(close shot of Zuko smiling)I'll make a fire.(The camera pans upward toward the cliffside and then the mansion)There's plenty of stuff to burn in there.\n\nSokka:This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?\n\n",

"Aang:(Aang crawls forward)We can. Jump on Appa. I'll try to\n\nAang:(out of breath)I'm ok.(Momo jumps on to Aang's back)\n\n",

"Toph:Well, that was random.\n\nKatara:I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are.(looks at Aang)\n\n",

"Ty Lee:What are you doing?\n\nZuko:What does it look like I'm doing?\n\n",

"Ty Lee: But it's a painting of your family.\n\nZuko:You think I care?\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(voice over)I think you do.\n\nZuko:You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business!(He turns away from her)\n\n",

"Ty Lee:(Close shot of Ty Lee, who looks down and speaks softly)I know you.\n\nZuko:No, you don't.(he waves his arm angrily)You're stuck in your little Ty Lee world, where everything's great all the time.\n\n",

"Mai:Zuko, leave her alone.\n\nZuko:(mocking)'I'm so pretty, look at me. I can walk on my hands, whoo!'(Zuko does a hand stand. Cut to shot of Ty Lee looking sad. Cut back to Zuko who is upside down. He lets himself fall to the sand)Circus freak!\n\n",

"Azula:(laughs)\n\nTy Lee: Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want.(gestures toward Azula, who looks away)You wanna know why I joined the circus?\n\n",

"Ty Lee:Do you have any idea what my home life was like, growing up with six sisters who look exactly like me? (she stands up) I joined the circus because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least, I'm different now.",

"Ty Lee: Circus freak is a compliment!\n\nMai: Guess that explains why you need 10 boyfriends, too.\n\nTy Lee:I'm sorry, what?\n\nMai:Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so(looking downward)you're trying to make up for it now.",

"Ty Lee:Well, what's your excuse, Mai? You were an only child for 15 years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray...\n\nMai:I don't believe in auras.\n\nZuko:Yeah, you don't believe in anything.\n\n",

"Mai:Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.\n\nZuko:I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once, instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside. She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?\n\n",

"Mai: You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't. I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted. As long as I behaved... and sat still...and didn't speak unless spoken to. My mother said I had to keep out of trouble.",

"Azula:That's it, then. You had a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.\n\nMai: You want me to express myself? Leave me alone!",

"\n\nZuko:I like it when you express yourself.(he reaches for her, but she backs away)\n\nMai:(yelling)Don't touch me. I'm still mad at you.\n\nZuko:My life hasn't been that easy, either, Mai.(Mai interrupts him)\n\n",

"Mai: Whatever- that doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.\n\nTy Lee:Calm down, you guys.(cut to Ty Lee and Azula sitting behind her)This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out.\n\n",

"Zuko:(angrily)Bad skin?(Ty Lee cringes. Cut to shot of Zuko looking toward her)Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face.(Zuko points toward his scar)\n\nTy  Lee:Sorry, Zuko, I...\n\n",

"Zuko:For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home, now my dad talks to me. Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero.Everything should be perfect, right I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why.",

"Azula:There's a simple question you need to answer then.(she leans forward)Who are you angry at?\n\nZuko:No one,(he looks down)I'm just angry.\n\nMai:Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?\n\n",

"Zuko:Everyone...(he covers his ears in frustration)I don't know.\n\nAzula:Is it Dad?\n\nZuko:No, no!\n\nTy Lee:Your uncle?\n\nAzula:Me?\n\nZuko:No, no... No, no.\n\n",

"Mai:Then who? Who are you angry at?\n\nAzula:(sternly)Answer the question, Zuko.\n\nTy lee:(pleading)Talk to us.\n\nMai:Come on, answer the question.\n\nAzula:Come on, answer it.\n\nZuko: (yells suddenly)I'm angry at myself!\n\n",

"Azula:Why?\n\nZuko:Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.\n\n",

"Azula:You're pathetic.\n\nMai:I know one thing I care about...(Cut to shot of Mai smiling at Zuko)I care about you.(Mai and Zuko kiss. Azula claps, causing them to separate and turn toward Azula. The camera pans left to include her.)\n\n",

"Azula:(still clapping slowly)Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.\n\nZuko:I guess you wouldn't understand,(pulls Mai to him)would you, Azula(sarcastically)Because you're just so perfect.\n\n",

"Azula:Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. My own mother... thought I was a monster. She was right, of course but it still hurt.\n\n",

"Ty Lee:What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves.(Cut to close shot of Ty Lee. She picks up a smooth stone)I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this.\n\n",

"Azula:You know what would make this trip\n\nAzula:We've got some bad news, Chan.\n\n",

"Act I\n\nRoku:Aang, it's time you learned my history with Fire Lord Sozin. You need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it. Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice.\n\n",

"Aang:(talking in his sleep)Okay, Roku.\n\nZuko:(speaking aloud)You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny.\n\n",

"Aang:There it is. That's Roku's home.\n\nKatara:(confused)But there's nothing here.\n\n",

"Toph:(somberly)Yes, there is. An entire village. Hundreds\n\nAzula:It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko.(sarcastically) Make sure he gets your good side.\n\n",

"Zuko:Wait. I need to ask you something. What do you remember about our Great-Grandfather's history?\n\nAzula:(sighs)Ah, Zuko. It's so strange how your mind works.\n\n",

"Zuko: But how did he die?\n\nAzula:Didn't you pay any attention in school, Zuko?",

"Roku:Come, Aang.(The three fly off over the clouds)\n\nAang:(curious)Where are we going?\n\n",

"Aang:(surprised) Youwere friends with Fire Lord Sozin?!\n\nRoku:Back then, he was just Prince Sozin, and he was my best friend.\n\n",

"Sozin: (nudging Roku)Say something to her.\n\nRoku:Uh...ahhh.\n\n",

"Roku:Love is hard when you're young.\n\nAang:You don't have to tell me.\n\n",

"Roku: Don't worry, It gets better. Now come with me. We have a party to attend.\n\nAang:Wait, whose party is it?\n\nRoku:Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday.\n\nSozin:(concerned)Did something happen to my father?\n\n",

"Fire Nation Sage:No, Prince Sozin. We are not here for you. We are here to announce the identity of the next Avatar. It is our honor to serve you, Avatar Roku.\n\n",

"Sozin:(narrates)Soon the day came when my friend Roku had to leave the Fire Nation and face his destiny as the Avatar. He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements.\n\nSozin:Hey, why aren't you packed yet, all-powerful Avatar?\n\n",

"Sozin:(smiling)Come on, show me how it's done...using all four kinds of bending.\n\nRoku:(depressed)I started packing, but then the fire sages told me I won't need any worldly possessions anymore.(Cut to Sozin, who loses his smile, and sits down beside his friend.\n\n",

"Sozin:(saddened)Oh.\n\nRoku:It happened so fast. Everything's going to be different now.\n\n",

"Sozin:(leans in)I want you to have it.\n\nKatara:(disgusted)Do they have bathrooms in the spirit world?\n\n",

"Sokka:(raising his index finger)As a matter of fact, they do not.\n\nAang:(excited)Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple.\n\n",

"Roku:This was the first stop on my avatar journey.\n\nRoku:It was the place where I was trained to master airbending and also where I met an old friend of yours, Monk Gyatso.\n\n",

"Aang:(surprised)No way.\n\nRoku:Hey, Gyatso, you want to see a new glider trick?(Roku flies up and loops twice in the air.)\n\n",

"Gyatso:(laughing)Check this out.(Gyatso flips his himself over, and stands on top of his glider. Cut to Roku and Aang, sitting on Fang.)\n\nAang:(impressed))He's air-surfing. I can't believe I never thought of that.\n\n",

"Aang:(smiling)That's amazing. I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was.(The camera pans out quickly to show Roku.)\n\nRoku:(fondly)Some friendships are so strong,(closes his eyes)they can even transcend lifetimes.\n\n",

"Roku:(cheerfully)Sozin, or should I say, Fire Lord.\n\nSozin:(seriously)Customarily, my subjects bow before greeting me, but you're the exception.\n\n",

"Roku:After all these years, he was still my best friend And a few months later, he was my best man.\n\nAang:(excited)Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you were alive.\n\n",

"Roku:Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over.\n\nRoku:I'm sparing you, Sozin. I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship, but I warn you, even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end.\n\n",

"Act III\n\nRoku:(narrates)Sozin and I didn't speak or see each other for 25 years after our battle. I spent most of my spare time here at my home.\n\n",

"Roku:(reaches for Ta Min)Let's go.\n\nSozin:(narrates)Roku's island was 100 miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe.\n\n",

"Aang:(in awe)This is amazing, Roku. You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.\n\nRoku:Unfortunately, my success didn't last, Aang. There was no way I could do it all.\n\n",

"Ruko:(narrates)Battling the elements was hard enough. I had to do it while I could barely breathe. The poisonous, volcanic gasses were overwhelming.\n\nRoku:(covering his face with his arm)It's all right, Fang. Get out of here, I'm fine.\n\n",

"Sozin:Need a hand, old friend?\n\nRoku:(surprised)Sozin?!\n\n",

"Sozin:There's not a moment to waste.\n\nRuko:Don't breathe the toxic gas.\n\n",

"Roku:(shaking)It's... too much.\n\nRoku:(begging)Please...\n\n",

"Sozin:(callously)Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible.\n\nSozin:I have a vision for the future, Roku.\n\n",

"Aang:(off camera)Who's... wait, that's me, isn't it?\n\nRuko: Make sense of our past Aang, and you will bring peace and restore balance in the world.\n\n",


"Iroh:(looks up toward Zuko)No...he wasn't.\n\nZuko:(irked)What are you talking about?\n\n",

"Iroh:You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.\n\nZuko:(shocked)Why are you telling me this?\n\n",

"Katara:(in disbelief)You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together... even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that?\n\nToph:It's like these people are born bad.\n\n",

"Aang>:No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.\n\nSokka:(confused)Then what was the point?\n\n",

"Toph:Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?\n\nAang:(grabbing Toph's hand)I don't see why not.\n\nSokka:(stroking his face)Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that..\n\n",

"Toph:How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!\n\nKatara:You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.\n\n",

"Aang: Ok, I'm ready for some training!\n\nToph:Good job, twinkle-toes. Visualize - then attack!\n\n",

"Katara:(angrily)Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph.\n\nToph:(obnoxiously)What's the matter? Can't handle some dirt, Madame Fussy Britches?\n\n",

"Katara:Oh, sorry, did I splash you,mud slug?\n\nAang:(still blindfolded)Are we taking a break?\n\n",

"Sokka:Yaaaaaah,sneak attack!\n\nAang:Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.\n\n",

"Toph:Hungry for a mud pie?\n\nKatara:I'll give you a mud pie.\n\n",

"Aang:Uh, guys, I thought we were supposed to be trainingme.\n\nKatara:(salvaging what dignity she can)Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today.\n\n",

"Toph:(derisively)While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun!\n\nSokka and Aang:Yes! Yeah!\n\n",

"Sokka:Look at all those messenger hawks. You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone... I could just send them messages!\n\nToph:(jokingly)I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you.\n\n",

"Aang:So, guys, what are we gonna get with our last silver piece?\n\nToph:We can get more money. Right there.",

"Toph: This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending.",

"Dealer:You there. Want to play a friendly game?\n\nToph:How could I possibly play? I'm blind.\n\n",

"Dealer: You don't have to see to be lucky.\n\nAang:Flamey-o, Toph!\n\n",

"Dealer:Wow, fancy guessing. You are amazing at this. Would you like to make the game a little more interesting?\n\nToph:More interesting? How?\n\n",

"Dealer:Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there. Then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting.\n\nToph:I'll do it for forty silver pieces.\n\n",

"Dealer:Forty silver pieces it is. Sorry, little lady, but...(to his shock, the pea is still there)...huh?\n\nToph:I won!\n\n",

"Katara:(startled)Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?\n\nAang:Toph got us money. She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.\n\n",

"Sokka:She used earthbending to win the game. Classic!\n\nKatara:Ah, so she cheated.\n\n",

"Toph:Hey, I only cheated because he was cheating. I cheated a cheater. What's wrong with that?\n\nKatara:I'm just saying, this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.\n\n",

"Toph:Why? Because its fun, and youhatefun?\n\nKatara:(indignantly)I don't hate fun.(She seizes Momo and drapes him on top of her head.)See? Fun.\n\n",

"Aang:Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.\n\nKatara:Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.\n\n",

"Toph:Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?\n\nKatara:Oh, I'm sorry. You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child?\n\n",

"Toph:Yeah, maybe. Maybe then, you'd see how great we have it. I mean, look at us. We're traveling around the world, making easy money, having fun, with no parents to tell us what to do.\n\nKatara:Ah, I see. You're acting like this because of your parents.\n\n",

"Toph:(dismissively)Whatever.\n\nKatara:They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty.\n\n",

"Toph:Idohate them!\n\nKatara:I don't think so. I think you miss them. But you just don't want to deal with that, so instead, you act like this crazy person.\n\n",

"Toph:Look. I ran away to help Aang!\n\nKatara:You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.\n\n",

"Sokka:Speaking of that third-eyed freak... I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of...\"Sparky-Sparky Boom Man\"!(The gaang are unimpressed.)Just think about it.\n\nKatara:We have enough money. You need to stop this!\n\n",

"Toph:I'll stop when I want to stop, and not when you tell me!",

"Sokka: Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner. And as such, I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't want to see any fighting. Good wittle messenger Hawky. Who's got pwetty feathers?\n\n",

"Act II\n\nSokka:Toph, when I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.\n\n",

"Toph:Well, itsoundslike a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what'sonthe sheet of paper.\n\nSokka:It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you \"The Runaway.\"\n\n",

"Toph: Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?\n\nSokka:Well, yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. But Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.\n\n",

"Toph:Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. Think of it this way. Now you have plenty of money to help with the invasion plan!\n\nSokka:Well, thatistrue. I had this idea of making armor for Appa.\n\n",

"Toph:Here's a little extra so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? Make it an atlas.\n\nSokka:I do like expensive atlases.\n\n",

"Toph:Of course you do. And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret.\n\nKatara:Sokka, tell me you didn't buy a bird.\n\n",

"Sokka:Not just a bird. A messenger bird! Now we can send messages all over the world, even to Gran-Gran.\n\nAang:Wow, how does it work?\n\n",

"Sokka:Hm, uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky: Gran-Gran, South Pole.(He points helpfully. Hawky shakes his head in confusion.)I think he gets it.Hawky, make nice! Bad Hawky!",

"Katara:Well, look who decided to join us. Where have you two been? Off scamming again?\n\nToph:Yes, we were.\n\nKatara:And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?\n\nToph:No, I don't.\n\nKatara:Really?\n\n",

"Katara:Well then, what's this?\n\nToph:(exasperated)I don'tknow! I mean, seriously, what's with you people I'm blind!",

"\n\nKatara:It's a wanted poster of you. \"The Runaway\". Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?\n\nToph:Where did you get that?!\n\nKatara:It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is...\n\n",

"Toph:You went through my stuff! You had no right.\n\nKatara:Your stuff was messy, and I was just straightening up and I happened to stumble across it.\n\n",

"Toph:That's a lie! You'relying, Katara.\n\nKatara:Fine! It's a lie. But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up. I knew you were hiding something, and you were. Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!\n\n",

"Toph:Oh, really,Mom? Or what are you going to do? Send me to my room?\n\nKatara:I wish I could.\n\n",

"Toph:Well, youcan't. Because you're not my mom, and you're nottheirmom.\n\nKatara:I never said I was!\n\n",

"Toph:No, but you certainly act like it. You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not. You're just a regular kid like the rest of us, so stop acting like you can tell me what to do. I can do whatever I want!\n\nKatara:(chagrined)I don't act that way.",

"Katara: Sokka, do I act motherly?\n\nSokka:Hey - I'm staying out of this one.\n\nKatara:What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?\n\nAang:Well, I...\n\nKatara:Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!\n\n",

"Aang:(chastened)Yes, ma'am.\n\nToph:I can't be around you right now!\n\n",

"Katara:Well, I can't be around you!\n\nSokka:I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?\n\n",

"Sokka: Hey, Aang, you want to test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.\n\nAang:Sure.\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm gonna send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.\n\nAang:I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.\n\n",

"Sokka:Eh, it's a gift.(He takes pen and paper and composes a missive.)Dear Katara. Sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.\n\nKatara:Iknowthis is from you, Sokka. Tophcan't write. Ugh, you're all driving me crazy!\n\n",

"Aang:I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.\n\nSokka:Yep, we're idiots.\n\n",

"Aang:I guess plan B is, we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.\n\nSokka:I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.(He walks over to Toph.)Come on, we need to talk.\n\n",

"Toph:So let me guess. You brought me out here to tell me your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.\n\nSokka:Nah, she's pretty much a pain. She's always got to be right about everything, and she gets all bossy, and involved, and in your business.\n\n",

"Toph:Yeah, I don't know how you can deal with it.\n\nSokka:Actually, in a way, I rely on it.\n\n",

"Toph:I don't understand.\n\nSokka:When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara, she had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.\n\n",

"Toph:I guess I never thought about that.\n\nSokka:I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly, I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like, my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me.",

"Toph:The truth is, sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. Don't ever tell her I said any of this.\n\nSokka:Hey, my lips are sealed.\n\n",

"Katara:Hi, Toph. Um, I want to...\n\nToph:Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.\n\n",

"Katara:(slyly)Actually, I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say... I want to pull a scam with you!\n\nToph:What?Youwant to pull a scam?\n\n",

"Katara:Not just any scam...the ultimate scam!(The boys collapse, stupefied.)What do you say, Toph? Just me and you... one last go. You in?\n\nToph:You know I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours?\n\n",

"Toph:How could you do this to me? You betrayed me.\n\nKatara:You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.\n\n",

"Mayor:You did the right thing by turning in \"The Runaway\".\n\nKatara:(sanctimoniously)The right thing is its own reward.\n\n",

"Mayor:Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.\n\nKatara:(disconcerted)But... I still want the actual reward.\n\n",

"Mayor:Of course. Right this way.\n\nToph:(alarmed)Hey, what kind of cell is this?\n\n",

"Female Fire Nation Officer:(through the bars)A wooden one.\n\nMayor:That's her. That's the girl you were looking for.\n\n",

"Aang:Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?\n\nSokka:I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out.(Leaving, he admonishes Hawky and Momo.)You two behave. Appa's in charge.\n\n",

"Toph:Wait. It's a trap!\n\nKatara:Really? No kidding. Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?\n\n",

"Toph:Not forus, Katara. We're the bait. He wantsAang.\n\nKatara:I can't believe I was so stupid. See, this is exactly why I'm against these scams. I knew this would happen.\n\n",

"Toph:But...this wasyouridea.\n\nKatara:I know. I wanted to show you that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.\n\n",

"Toph:Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.\n\nKatara:I know your relationship with your parents is complicated, and I shouldn't have said what I said.\n\n",

"Toph:It's ok. I was really mad when you said that because; well, because maybe it's true. I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.\n\nSokka:Where do you think they might be?\n\n",

"Aang:Where do you think anyone is?(Combustion Man appears on a rooftop) Sokka, watch out! It's \"Sparky-Sparky Boom Man\"!\n\nSokka:You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.\n\n",

"Katara:What are we gonna do?\n\nToph:I don't know! I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables!\n\n",

"(Katara wipes sweat from her forehead... and has an idea. She stands up and begins running in place. Toph is understandably puzzled.)Um, Katara...are you ok?\n\nKatara:Just fine.\n\nToph:Well, what are you doing?\n\n",

"Katara:I'm making my own water!\n\nToph:Katara, you're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!\n\n",

"Sokka:This guy is too good. He shoots fire from his brain!\n\nAang:We should split up. He can't chase us both.\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, get up!\n\nToph:Let's get out of here.\n\n",

"Sokka:Hey, I got it. The perfect name for that guy! \"Combustion Man\"!\n\nToph:Good job, Sokka. Now let's get out of here before \"Combustion Man\" catches us!\n\n",

"Sokka:See? It fits so well.\n\nSokka:Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy?(affectionately)Yeah, you're such a lazy little bird.\n\n",

"Toph:Katara, I need your help.\n\nKatara:What is it, Toph?\n\n",

"Toph:I need you to write some things down for me. I want to send a letter to my parents.\n\nKatara:I'll be happy to help.\n\n",

"Act I\n\nSokka:Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark. Oooh... It came into the torchlight. And they knew the blade of Wing - Fun was haunted! Aah-ah...\n\n",

"Aang:I think I liked \"the man with a sword for a hand\" better.\n\nToph:Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.\n\n",

"Katara:No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.\n\nSokka:Is this one of those \"a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to\" stories?\n\n",

"Katara:No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day. But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.\n\nToph:Wait. Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming.",

"Sokka:Pft, nice try.\n\nToph:No, I'm serious, I hear something.\n\n",

"Katara:You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories.\n\nToph:It just stopped.\n\n",

"Sokka:Yes, please.\n\nKatara:Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.\n\n",

"Hama:Aren't you sweet? You know, you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.\n\nSokka:What do you mean, disappearing?\n\n",

"Hama:Wakey-wakey.(Sokka wakes up and rubs his eyes. Cut to Sokka's perspective as she leans over him and smiles)Time to go shopping.\n\nKatara:That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages.\n\n",

"Hama:You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly.\n\nTownsman:You won't have any ash bananas till next week?\n\n",

"Merchant:Well, I have to send the boy to Hing-Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.\n\nTownsman:Oh, right, tomorrow's the full moon.\n\n",

"Merchant:Exactly, I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods.\n\nSokka:People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff during full moons... this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans.\n\n",

"Aang:I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.\n\nSokka:And then you can sew up this little mystery, lickety-split, Avatar-style.\n\n",

"Aang:Helping people...that's what I do.\n\nHama:Why don't you all take those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.\n\n",

"Sokka:This is a mysterious little town you have here(looks right into Hama's face).\n\nHama:(cryptically and smiling)Mysterious town for mysterious children.\n\n",

"Sokka:That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.\n\nKatara:That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kind of reminds me of Gran-Gran.\n\n",

"Sokka:But what did she mean by that comment, \"mysterious children\"?\n\nKatara:(sarcastically)Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?\n\n",

"Sokka:I'm gonna take a look around.\n\nKatara:Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house.\n\n",

"Sokka:It'll be fine.\n\nAang:She could be home any minute.\n\n",

"Katara:(nervous)Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude.\n\nSokka:I'm not finished yet.[grunts]Come on...\n\n",

"Aang:Ok, that's pretty creepy.\n\nKatara:(closes the doors)So... she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Sokka, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon.\n\n",

"Sokka:Just an ordinary, puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Then why does she have a locked door up here?\n\nKatara:(angry)Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff.\n\n",

"Sokka:We'll see.(peers in through the keyhole. Cut to his perspective. The camera zooms in on a small chest, sitting in the light shining through the attic window)It's empty except for a little chest.\n\nToph:(excitedly)Maybe it's treasure.\n\n",

"Katara:Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room.\n\nSokka:I have to see what's in there.\n\n",

"Aang:We shouldn't be doing this.\n\nSokka:Maybe there's a key here somewhere.\n\n",

"Toph:Oh, hand it over.\n\nSokka:Come on,come on!\n\n",

"Toph:This isn't as easy it looks.\n\nAang:(nervous)Guys, I don't know about this.\n\n",

"Katara:This is crazy, I'm leaving.\n\nSokka:Suit yourself. Do it, Toph.\n\n",

"Hama:I'll tell you what's in the box.\n\nSokka:(disbelief)An old comb?\n\n",

"Hama:It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I owned from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Katara:You're from the Southern Water Tribe?\n\nHama:Just like you.\n\n",

"Katara:How did you know?\n\nHama:I heard you talking around your campfire.\n\n",

"\n\nHama:I wanted to surprise you. I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big, Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes, if you stew them long enough.",

"Aang:(grimaces in utter disgust)Great.\n\nKatara:I knew I felt a bond with you right away.\n\n",

"Sokka:And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.(Katara punches him in the arm)But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.\n\nHama:Apology accepted. Now let's get cooking.\n\n",

"Aang:I'd steer clear of the \"sea prunes\".\n\nToph:I thought they were ocean kumquats.\n\n",

"Aang:Close enough.\n\nHama:Who wants five-flavor soup?\n\n",

"Katara:You're a Waterbender! I've never met another Waterbender from our tribe.\n\nHama:(sadly)That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one.\n\n",

"Sokka:So how did you end up out here?\n\nHama:I was stolen from my home.(fade to a flashback of a young Hama in the Southern Water Tribe)It was over 60 years ago when the raids started.\n\n",

"Hama:(voice over)They came again and again, each time, rounding up more of our Waterbenders, and taking them captive.\n\nHama>:(voice over)We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued.\n\n",

"Hama:(voice over)Finally, I too was captured.\n\nHama:(voice over)I was led away in chains. The last Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe.\n\n",

"Hama:They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.\n\nSokka:How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?\n\n",

"Hama:I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.\n\nKatara:We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.\n\n",

"Hama:(patting Katara's hand)Oh, you poor things.\n\nKatara:I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor, you're a hero.\n\n",

"Hama:I never thought I'd meet another Southern Waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know, so you can carry on the Southern Tradition when I'm gone.\n\nKatara:(excitedly)Yes, yes of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.\n\n",

"Hama:That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.\n\nKatara:I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.\n\n",

"Toph:Maybe the moon spirit just turned mean.\n\nSokka:(furious)The moon spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and... lunar goodness.\n\n",

"Aang:Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?\n\nTraveling Townsman:Only one man ever saw it and lived, and that's Old Man Ding.\n\n",

"Toph:Where does Old Man Ding live?\n\nKatara:Wow, these flowers are beautiful.\n\n",

"Hama:You can take it even further.\n\nKatara:That was incredible.(stares down at the flowers sadly)It's a shame about the lilies, though.\n\n",

"Katara:But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.\n\n",

"Hama:Oh, Katara. Two master Waterbenders beneath a full moon? I don't think we haveanythingto worry about.\n\nAang:(off screen)Old Man Ding?\n\n",

"Sokka:Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?\n\nToph:Oh, no!(she startles Aang and Sokka)I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there.\n\n",

"Sokka:I can't see anything down there.\n\nToph:(takes Sokka's hand)That's why you have me, let's go.\n\n",

"1st Male Prisoner:We're saved.\n\nAang:I didn't know that spirits made prisons like this, who brought you here?\n\n",

"Female Prisoner:It was no spirit.\n\n2nd Male Prisoner:It was a witch.\n\n",

"Sokka:A witch, what do you mean?\n\nMale Prisoner:She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster.\n\n",

"Sokka:(angry)Hama!\n\n1st Male Prisoner:Yes, the innkeeper.\n\n",

"Sokka:I knew there was something creepy about her.\n\nAang:We have to stop Hama!\n\n",

"Toph:I'll get these people out of here, you go.\n\nHama:What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched, Fire Nation prison. The guards were always careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air, and had us suspended away from the ground.\n\n",

"Hama: The choice is not yours. The power exists...and it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture... your mother!\n\nKatara:I know.\n\n",

"Hama:They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters. They deserve the same. You must carry on my work.\n\nKatara:(defiant)I won't! I won't use bloodbending, and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town.\n\n",

"Hama:You should have learned the technique before you turned against me.(makes Katara stand straight up, stiff)It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip. I control every muscle, every vein in your body.\n\nKatara:Stop...please.\n\n",

"Katara:You're not the only one who draws power from the moon. My bending ismorepowerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!\n\nSokka:We know what you've been doing, Hama!\n\n",

"Aang:Give up, you're outnumbered.\n\nHama:No. You've outnumbered yourselves.\n\n",

"Sokka:Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own. Stop it, arm, stop it!\n\nAang:This feels weird.\n\n",

"Katara:I'm sorry, Aang.\n\nAang:(off screen)It's ok.\n\n",

"Hama:Don't hurt your friends, Katara... and don't let them hurt each other.\n\nKatara:No!\n\n",

"1st Prisoner:You're going to be locked away forever.\n\nHama:My work is done.(cut to a close up as she turns her head to Katara)Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.\n\n",


"Act I\n\nSokka:(looking at a map)This is it, the official rendezvous point for the invasion force.\n\n",

"Toph:How did you pick this place?\n\nSokka:Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on a map. It's\n\n",

"Katara:(cut to close-up ground level shot of the gang preparing for bed)Nice choice Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.\n\nAang:(shocked)Wait,(shoots out of bed and high into the air)four days! The invasion's in four days!\n\n",

"Sokka: Whatever.(nonchalant)That's like... four days from now.(lays back onto his mat)Let's just calm down, and ...(snore)\n\nKatara:Sokka's got the right idea Aang. We're here, we're ready...(lays down on her mat)the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.",

"Aang:Uh..(looks around frantically but everyone seems to be asleep)I guess.\n\nAang:(continually making a series of comically fast and dramatic ninja-like moves during this speech)Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down!\n\n",

"1st Servant:(a servant steps forward with a bowl)Fresh fruit, Prince Zuko?(Zuko gestures him away)\n\n2nd Servant:(eagerly)May I wash your feet, sir?(Zuko again gestures a decline)\n\n",

"1st Servant:Head massage?(Zuko looks away)\n\n2nd  Servant:(close shot of some neatly bundled and steaming towels)Hot towel?\n\n",

"Palanquin Servant:Prince Zuko, is something wrong? You didn't take the palanquin.\n\nZuko:I'm just going to Mai's house, it's not far.\n\n",

"Palanquin Servant:It's not a Prince's place to walk anywhere, sir.\n\nKatara:Hey, how long have you been up?\n\n",

"Aang:A couple hours.(Aang circles the tree, doing some fancy footwork and varying the type of punches)I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm going to fight Ozai.\n\nKatara:(close shot of Aang, very out of breath)You know there is such a thing as over-training.\n\n",

"Aang:You don't get it, do you? My form is bad. I'm sloppy. And I still don't know any firebending, not even the basics.\n\nSokka:That's okay Aang. The eclipse will block all firebending anyway, you don't need to know any. Plus it's a stupid element.\n\n",

"Aang:Okay, well, I still have to work on everything else. I'd better spend the whole day training.\n\nAang: (wide shot of the group on the cliffside)Good night Katara. Good night Sokka. Good night Toph. Good night Appa. Good night Momo. Good night Appa and Momo.\n\n",

"Toph:(yelling)Go to sleep already!\n\nAang:(He points coolly)Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down... and this time I brought pants.(The camera pans down to reveal the chains are meant to lock on the pants)\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(Cut to very close shot of the Fire Lord)So it seems.(He stands up and a giant abacus falls from the ceiling)But are you prepared for your mathematics test?\n\nAang: Math test?! Oh no! I forgot all about the math test! I've got to be ready!\n\n",

"Katara:Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.\n\nAang:(ground level shot of Aang looking wild and still concentrated on the Koala-Sheep)But I forgot my pants and my math test.\n\n",

"Katara:(Katara sighs, and then breathes in deeply, she moves forward and grabs Aang's shoulders. Aang's very bloodshot eyes turn toward her)Aang, sleep. Please...for me.\n\nZuko:Tell me, if you can have anything you wanted right now, what would it be?\n\n",

"Mai:Hmm. A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top.\n\nZuko:(cut to close up shot of Zuko and Mai)You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen.\n\n",

"Mai:(giggles)That would be impressive.\n\nZuko:Do you think(the guards turn towards the couple and bow)you can find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top.\n\n",

"Royal Servant: Excellent choice, sir.\n\nMai: I guess there are some perks that come with being royalty. Though, there is annoying stuff too, like that all-day war meeting coming up.\n\n",

"Zuko: War meeting? What are you talking about?\n\nMai:Azula mentioned something, I assumed you were going too.\n\n",

"Zuko: I guess I wasn't invited.\n\nFire Lord Ozai:Wake up Aang. Wake up sleepy-head. Rise and shine. You over-slept. You missed the invasion.\n\n",

"Aang:Sokka get up! I need to know what day it is!(Aang pulls on Sokka's eyelids and lips in a comedic fashion.)\n\nSokka:What?\n\n",

"Toph:(cut to Toph sitting up, Katara visible in the background)Relax, it's still two days before the invasion.\n\nAang:(cut to Aang hopping around the sleepy Sokka, tugging on various limbs)Sokka, you've got to get up and drill your rock climbing exercises.\n\n",

"Sokka:What?\n\nAang: In one of my dreams, you were running from fire nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you were too slow and they got you.\n\n",

"Sokka:But that was just a dream,(points at Aang)I'm a great climber.\n\nAang:(points upward)Then climb that cliff. Climb it fast!\n\n",

"Sokka:(annoyed)Stupid Avatar. Stupid cliff. Stupid dream! I can climb fast!\n\nAang:(Yells, causing Sokka to startle and slip down the cliff face)Don't drink that!\n\n",

"Katara:(cut to Katara holding Aang's cheek)Aang, I know you're just trying to help. But you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling.\n\nAang:You're right. I'm losing my mind.\n\n",

"Aang:It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big, growing snowball of nerves.",

"Sokka: (to stressed Aang) Of course you are. That's 'cause you've got to fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win, or we're all done for.\n\nKatara:Sokka, you're not helping!\n\nSokka: What? It's true. That's the deal, he knows it.\n\n",

"Katara:Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out.\n\nSokka:(speaking in a mocking, old man sounding, psychiatric tone)Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.\n\n",

"Aang:(close aerial shot of Aang looking disgruntled)You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.\n\nSokka:Mhm.(nods and gestures toward Aang)Tell me more about this, 'Fire Lord.' Why are you so afraid of him?\n\n",

"Aang:You said it yourself. He's the baddest man on the planet. I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world.\n\nSokka:Hmm. Life does feel that way some times, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.\n\n",

"Aang:Okay, but what can I do to feel better?\n\nSokka:Want to try screaming into this pillow?\n\n",

"Azula:Hello Zu-zu. If you've come for a royal hair combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.\n\nZuko:So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh. And apparently I'm not welcome there.\n\n",

"Azula:What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there.\n\nZuko:(close shot of Zuko, perturbed)Oh yeah? I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it.\n\n",

"Azula:Oh Zuko, don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably weren't invited, because it's so obvious that you're supposed to be there.\n\nZuko:(close up on Zuko, questioning)Well, were you invited?\n\n",

"Azula:(close shot of Azula, looking smug)Of course. I'm the Princess.\n\nZuko:(annoyed)And I'm the Prince!\n\n",

"Azula:Exactly, so stop acting(gestures)like a paranoid child.(close up shot of Zuko looking annoyed)Just go to the meeting.\n\nZuko:Forget it, I'm not going.\n\n",

"Toph:Alright, what you need is a good old fashioned back poundin' to relieve your stress.\n\nAang:Pound away.(Toph begins to stomp her feet causing the pillars to pummel Aang)Ahh! Ow! Uh! Toph!(close shot of Aang in serious pain)I ... think ... this is bruising ... me!",

"Toph:Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin.(close shot of Toph looking pensive)Well, there's one other thing we can try...acupuncture!\n\nAang:(Aang looks at the porcupine, screams and runs away)Ahhhh!\n\n",

"Mai:Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?\n\nZuko:I don't.\n\n",

"Mai:Well good. You shouldn't. Why would you even want to go?(Cut to shot of Zuko and Mai standing in the window, the Fire Nation Palace before them. Mai puts her arm around Zuko)Just think about how things went to the last war meeting you went to.\n\nZuko: I know.",

"Mai: You know what will make you feel better? Ordering some servants around! I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts! And maybe a little palanquin ride around town... Double time!",

"Aang:Thanks for everything guys.\n\n",

"Katara: So do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night sleep?\n\nAang:(close shot of Aang looking confused)Uhh...I kinda think I sorta might ... slightly feel a little better ... maybe.\n\n",

"Sokka:(cut to shot of Sokka)Then our work here is done.\n\nKatara:(worried)What happened Aang?\n\n",

"Aang:(Aang turns away from his friends and slumps over, bowing his head to the ground)It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.\n\nSokka:(cut to close shot of Sokka)Looks like it's time for...another therapy session.\n\n",

"Aang:(Aang looks up at him, disgusted and then turns around and speaks angrily)No, that won't help. Nothing helps.(close shot of Aang looking determined)There's only one thing I can do. I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion.\n\nAct III\n\n",

"Aang:Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.\n\nKatara:You don't look so good.(approaches Aang)You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?\n\n",

"Aang:(cut to close up shot of Aang turning towards Katara)I told you, I can't go back to sleep.\n\nKatara:Aang, staying up can't be good for you.\n\n",

"Aang:Actually staying up all night has given me some time to think.(Aang walks toward the ocean, Katara follows him)And I've realized some big things Katara.\n\nKatara:(close up shot of Katara)What big things?\n\n",

"Aang: I see everything so clearly now... what really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world,(turns toward Katara)but more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. I'm doing it for you Katara.",


"Aang:I'm saying...I love you.\n\nKatara:What are we doing?\n\n",

"Aang:What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby,(swings Katara on to her back and goes in for another kiss)you're my forever girl.\n\nKatara:Aang?\n\nAang:Huh?\n\nKatara:I was just saying you should take a nap.\n\n",

"Aang:Oh,(straightens up and faces Katara)I guess I kinda drifted off into a day-dream.\n\nKatara:What was your dream about?\n\n",

"Aang:(looks embarrassed)Uhh, living under water?\n\nKatara:(looks skeptical, then smiles)Sounds neat.\n\n",

"Aang:(close up shot of Aang breathing a sigh of relief)Heh. Phew.\n\nMessenger:Prince Zuko,(bows to the ground)everyone's waiting for you.\n\n",

"Zuko:(Zuko and Mai approach him)What?\n\nMessenger:The high admirals, high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived.(close up shot of the messenger raising his head to Zuko)You're the only person missing.\n\n",

"Zuko:(close up shot of Zuko and Mai. Mai is smiling)So, my dad wants me at the meeting?\n\nRoyal Messenger:The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir.(bows his head again)\n\n",

"Aang:Put 'em up, Fire Lord.\n\nSokka:Hey, I'm trying to build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He'syourbison ...\n\n",

"Aang: Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach. You think you're untouchable, don't you Mr. Fire Lord.\n\nVoice:Boy, you are really starting to lose it kid.\n\nAang:Momo, did you hear something.\n\nMomo:No, but I said something.\n\n",

"Aang:Uhh.\n\nMomo:You my friend are just a few plumbs short of a fruit pie.\n\n",

"Aang:That's more like it. I'm so tired, that for a second there I imagined you were talking to me. Oh, Momo... let me explain.\n\n",

"Sokka:(camera pans right to Sokka)You've been awake too long.\n\nToph:(camera pans right to Toph)And you're acting downright weird.\n\n",

"Appa: You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this.\n\nAang:Uhh. (Appa is still standing there like a human)I appreciate what you guys are saying. But the stress and the nightmares, they were too much.\n\n",

"Momo:(Momo stands up and points his finger at Appa)Yeah, leave the kid alone.\n\nAppa:(Appa points back down at Momo, looking Angry)Hey, who asked you?\n\n",

"Aang:Guys...come on.\n\nAppa:(Close up shot of Appa looking angry)No! I'm sick of this guy always mouthing off,(Cut to shot of Momo who is very madand telling me what to do.\n\n",

"Aang:Oh, you don't like i?  Well let's go right now.\n\nAang:Sokka, what should we do?\n\n",

"Sokka:About what?\n\nAang:About that!(turns toward Appa and Momo)\n\n",

"Koala Sheep:Appa! Appa! Appa!\n\nKoala Sheep:Momo! Momo! Momo!\n\n",

"Aang:Come on guys, we're all on the same side!\n\nGuru Pathik:Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras! Chakras, chakras... chakra sandwich tastes good, yum!\n\nKoala Sheep:Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!\n\nAang:Huh? Huh!\n\n",

"Koala Sheep:Yay! Yay! Yay!\n\nAang:(yelling)I just need a jump in a cold waterfall.\n\n",

"Mai:So, how did it go?\n\nZuko:When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me.(cut to close up shot of Zuko)My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him.(cut to wider shot of Zuko and Mai walking)I was literally at his right hand.\n\n",

"Mai:Zuko, that's wonderful.(grabs on to him)You must be happy?\n\nZuko:During the meeting, I was theperfectprince.(close up shot of Ozai's face in the picture)The son my father wanted. But I wasn't me.\n\n",

"Aang:Oh look, another hallucination. An imaginary bed, made out of clouds.\n\nToph:Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it.\n\n",

"Sokka:We made it for you. A good night sleep will probably take the crazy away... we hope.\n\nAang:Look, you guys keep telling me I need to sleep, but I can't, the invasion's tomorrow.\n\n",

"Katara:(imploringly)Aang...\n\nAang:(determined)No Katara, there's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me.(raises his fists in a feeble attempt)\n\n",

"Katara:I'm not going to hit you.\n\nToph:(eager)You want me to do it?\n\n",

"Katara:Listen to me,(grabs Aang's shoulder)you've been training for this since the day we've met. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.\n\nAang:(close shot of Aang turning to Katara)You really think so?\n\n",

"Sokka:(cut to Toph and Sokka. Sokka's arms open)We all do. You can do this. You're ready.\n\nToph:You're the man,(points at Aang)Twinkle-toes.\n\n",

"Aang:Thanks guys.(close shot of Aang smiling. He yawns and Katara helps him onto the fluffy Koala-Sheep wool bed.)You know what? I think I am ready.\n\nAang: (standing on the ledge below the Fire Lord)Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(cut to close shot of the Fire Lord)Really? You're going to take me out? You're not even wearing pants.(smiles menacingly)\n\nAang:(smiles slyly)No Fire Lord Ozai,(raises his sword)you're not wearing pants.\n\n",

"Katara: Sounds like you slept well.\n\nAang: Like a baby mooselion. I'm ready(in an attacking position)to face the Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Toph: So what's your strategy for taking him down? Going to get your glow on and hit him with a little Avatar State action?\n\nAang: I can't. When Azula shot me with lightning, my 7th chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the Universe.",

"Toph: You know what I just? heard Blah blah spiritual mumbo jumbo blah blah something about Space.\n\nKatara: Oh no. Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?\n\n",

"Sokka: No, that is the invasion.\n\nKatara: You made it Dad!\n\n",

"Sokka: Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?\n\nHakoda: I did. But I'm a little worried, Sokka.(Looks behind at Due and Tho who are descending from the ship)Some of these men aren't exactly the warrior type.\n\n",

"Due:(Excited and full of energy)Whooo-wheee. This place ain't\n\nTho: It's just a rock, Due.\n\n",

"Due: Well, I'll be.\n\nHakoda:(skeptical)Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf head?\n\n",

"Bato: I just wish they would wear pants.\n\nHue: Pants are an illusion and so is death.\n\n",

"Haru:(off screen)Hi, Katara.(Cut to a shot revealing Haru's face. He has grown some facial hair.)\n\nKatara: Haru,(runs and embraces him)it's so good to see you.\n\n",

"Tyro: (places a hand on their shoulders)You helped us find our courage, Katara. Now we're here to help you.\n\nToph: No way.(Gets into a defensive stance)Is that...(A pair of huge hands appear on screen and carries Toph up. Camera pans out to reveal The Hippo.)\n\n",

"Hippo:(embracing Toph)Hippo happy to see Blind Bandit!\n\nToph:(angrily)You guys here for a re-match?\n\n",

"Boulder:(Cut to a shot of Boulder standing behind Hippo)Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight(making \"no\" gesture with his hands)for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our Kingdom!(raises both arms up in enthusiasm.)\n\nToph: Sweet.(smiles)\n\n",

"Sokka: Was that a new invention?\n\nThe Mechanist: Yes.(Teo is seen licking the orange goo off his hands)But unfortunately, the incendiary capabilities of peanut sauce proved to be a failure.\n\n",

"Sokka: You're making peanut sauce bombs?\n\nPipsqueak: They're destructive.\n\n",

"The Duke:(continues)And Delicious!(Both proceed to lick sauce off their faces. Momo jumps on Pipsqueak and tries to lick his face to the amusement of both boys who laugh.)\n\nSokka: Were you able to complete work on the plans I sent you?\n\n",

"The Mechanist: Yes, I was and I think the Fire Nation would be quite surprised.\n\nTeo: Aang,(takes a pole-like object from his wheelchair)my Dad & I made this for you.\n\n",

"Aang:(Camera zooms out to reveal Aang admiring his new glider)A new glider! This is amazing.\n\nTheMechanist: And as a special feature, I added a snack compartment.(Places his head under the handle and pulls it. Peanuts tumble out of the compartment into his mouth.)\n\n",

"Ming: Breakfast.\n\nWarden Poon:(Stands up)Careful, Ming. Don't get too close. His stench will knock you right out.(He cackles and exits the room. Cut to a shot of Ming looking at him, annoyed.)\n\n",

"Ming: I snuck in some white jade tea. I know you like rare teas.\n\nIroh: Thank you, Ming.(takes the cup of tea)Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.(Ming tilts her head and smiles embarrassedly.)\n\n",

"Hakoda: Don't worry, you'll do great.\n\nSokka: Good morning, everyone!\n\n",

"Sokka: I messed up, Aang.\n\nAang: What?\n\nSokka: The invasion plan was my moment of truth. And I completely flopped it. I just fell apart.\n\nAang: Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking and nobody's really good at that.\n\n",

"Sokka: My Dad is. He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone. Like a real leader should.\n\nAang: Look, your moment of truth isn't going to be in front of some map. It's going to be out there,(points to the vast ocean in front of them)on the battlefield.\n\n",

"Sokka: You seem so confident about everything. How do you know we're going to win?\n\nAang: Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.\n\n",

"Bato:(voiceover) There they are.(Cut to Bato's point of view through the telescope which reveals a statue of Fire Lord Azulon surrounded by fog)The Great Gates of Azulon.\n\nKatara:(voiceover)I don't see any gates.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover.\n\nTho: We'll sneak by that statues just like we sneaked by that fire navy blockade.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Keep it up, we're almost through.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Hakoda:(ushers the invasion force)Everyone below deck.(The Gaang and a few Earth Kingdom soldiers are seen rushing to the deck below)Let's hope your invention works.\n\nMale Fire Nation Guard: No one's on board, Sir.\n\n",

"Female Fire Nation Guard:(lowers arms)Where'd they go?\n\nHakoda:(Cut to a shot of Sokka, Hakoda, Bato and Pipsqueak standing behind The Mechanist who is sitting in front of a control panel.)You really outdone yourself this time, son.\n\n",

"Toph:(Cut to Toph who is holding her head down.)Yeah. Congratulations, Sokka.(Lifts her head up. There's a look of discomfort on her face.)You managed to invent a worst way of travel than flying.\n\nThe Duke:(Takes off his helmet and offers it to Toph)Helmet?\n\n",


"Ming: Lunchtime, General Iroh.(whispering)And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.\n\nIroh: Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness had made my days in prison bearable.(looks concerned)I think you should take the rest of the day off.\n\n",

"Ming: What?(looking confused)\n\nIroh: You don't look well.(grabs the bars)Maybe you should go home and rest.\n\n",

"Ming: No, I feel fine.\n\nIroh: Trust me.(Cut to a close-up of Iroh looking rather serious)It is better that you are not here this afternoon.(Ming nods and complies as she reluctantly leaves the room.)\n\n",

"Aang: So, this is it huh?\n\nSokka: Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar's alive?\n\n",

"Aang: I'm ready.(Sokka grasps his arm, wishing him luck. The gang and Momo gather around for a group hug.)\n\nToph:(Cut to a close-up of Toph smiling.)I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, twinkle toes.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Everyone listen up. The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert and fight smart. Now break time's over, back in the subs.\n\nKatara: Aang, I.\n\n",

"Aang: Katara, I... \n\nAang: You go first.\n\n",

"Katara: We've been through so many things together and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.\n\n",

"Aang: Everything is going to be different after today, isn't it?\n\nKatara: Yes, it is.\n\nAang:(uncertain)What if... what if I don't come back?\n\n",

"Katara: Aang, don't say that. Of course you'll...\n\nSokka: Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge.\n\n",

"Katara:(snaps out of her dazed mood)What? Right, I'm on it.\n\nZuko: I'm sorry, Mai.(He walks towards Mai's bed and places a scroll on the pillow as the camera slowly zooms out.)\n\n",

"Aang: What did you know? It did come in handy. \n\nHakoda: Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks. This is going to be a rough ride.\n\nHakoda: Ready the torpedo.\n\nHakoda: Launch!\n\n",



"Due:(Due and Tho trace the path of the tank being thrown into a battlement. The battlement explodes into flames upon impact)Hey Hue,(waving)where you been?\n\nHue: Communing with nature. Takes a while to collect these\n\n",

"Sokka: Dad, look out!\n\nHakoda:(Looking at the above situation.)Sokka, we've got to take out those battlements. It's our only chance.\n\n",

"Sokka:(Looks up at a battlement and narrows his eyebrows)I've got an idea.\n\nHakoda:(All 3 dismount)You two take out that battlement. I've got this one. Watch each other's backs.(He heads towards his battlement while the siblings head towards the other.)\n\n",

"Katara: Dad?\n\nSokka: Dad!\n\n",

"Zuko: I know I made some bad choices. But today, I'm going to set things right.(He grabs his broadswords and backpack before looking at his Mother's portrait for one last time. He throws on his cloak and walks away.)\n\nKatara: How does that feel, Dad?\n\n",

"Hakoda: A... a little better.(sits up)I need... to get back... to the troops.(moans in agony.)\n\nKatara: You're hurt. Badly. You can't fight anymore.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Everyone's counting on me(winces from the pain)to lead this mission, Katara. I won't let them down.(tries to get up before falling back to the ground in pain.)\n\nSokka: Can't you heal him any faster?\n\n",

"Katara: I'm doing everything I can.(Cut to Sokka looking away before closing his eyes to make a decision.)\n\nSokka: I'll do it.\n\n",

"Katara: No offense Sokka but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.\n\nSokka: No.(stands up)I'll lead the invasion force.\n\n",

"Katara: Don't be crazy, Sokka.\n\nSokka: Maybe I am a little crazy but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano(looks at the volcano)by the time it does.\n\n",

"Hakoda:(lying on the ground)You can do this. I'm proud of you, son.\n\nKatara: I still think you're crazy but I'm proud of you too.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yip yip.\n\nSokka:(raising his voice)Listen up everyone,(Cut to Teo looking at Sokka inside the tank)I want the tanks in wedge formation!(his arms open upin a V-shape)Warriors and benders in the middle.We're taking that tower and headed for the royal palace!",

"Sokka:(grabs his sword and points toward the enemy)Charge!\n\nAang: That's strange.\n\n",

"Aang: The Avatar is back!\n\nAang: Hello?(looks around and walks slowly towards the inner palace doors)Anyone home?\n\n",

"Tyro:(The invasion force is seen making their way in.)The Fire Nation is falling back!\n\nBato: Sokka, we're on our way to victory.\n\n",


"Hakoda: Thanks to your sister. I'm in no shape to fight but maybe there is someway I could help.\n\nSokka: Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Let's hope our luck holds out. Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?\n\nKatara: Yeah... Is that... is that Aang?\n\n",

"Sokka: What?\n\nSokka: Please tell you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down?\n\n",

"Aang: He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.\n\nSokka: They knew.\n\n",

"Aang: It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.\n\nSokka: No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far.",




"Toph: If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it.\n\nSokka: The Mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse. 10 minutes to find the Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Aang: We can still do this. We can still win the day.\n\nKatara: Wait. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap. Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here safely.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.\n\n",

"Sokka: What do you think? You're the one who has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.\n\nAang: I've got to try.\n\nAang: Do you feel anything down there?\n\n",

"Toph:(her hand to the ground)Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.\n\nSokka: Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?\n\n",

"Toph:(she extends her hands to each side before plunging them into the ground, gripping the earth with her fingers)There's something big, dense, and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.\n\nSokka: Sounds like a secret bunker to me.\n\n",

"Aang: Stay safe. We'll be back soon.\n\nToph: This way! That one's a dead end.\n\n",

"Sokka: What would we do without you?\n\nToph: Perish and burn in hot magma.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeah, pretty much.\n\nToph: The tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker.\n\n",

"Sokka: We'll have to be fast but careful.\n\nAang: How was that careful?\n\n",

"Sokka: I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.\n\nSokka: There's no floor! It's just a river of lava.\n\n",

"Aang: Climb aboard and hold on tight.\n\nSokka: That's some door!\n\n",

"Toph: Not a problem.\n\nSokka: I am so glad we added you to the group.\n\n",

"Fire Nation Fighter #1: Retreat! Everyone move to secondary defensive position! Retreat!\n\nBato: The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up the hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished!\n\n",

"Katara: We can wait here if you want.\n\nHakoda: No. I want to press forward with the others.\n\n",

"War Minister Qin: The Fire Lord's chamber is that way down the hall to the left and up the stairs. You can't miss it.\n\nAang:(suddenly smiles cheerfully)Thanks.\n\n",

"Sokka: Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse.\n\nAang: I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Azula: So, you are alive after all.\n\nAzula: I had a hunch that you survived. It doesn't matter, I've known about the invasion for months.\n\n",

"Zuko: I'm ready to face you.\n\nFire Lord Ozai: Prince Zuko, what are you doing here?\n\n",

"Act II\n\nThe Mechanist: The eclipse is starting. Put on your eclipse glasses.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: Why are you here?\n\nZuko: I'm here to tell the truth.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. This should be interesting.\n\nZuko: First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: Why would she lie to me about that?\n\nZuko: Because the Avatar is not dead. He survived.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(alarmed)What?!\n\nZuko: In fact, he probably is leading this invasion. He could be on us right now.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(stands up and points, furious)Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you.\n\nZuko: That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(seething with rage)You will obey me or this defiant breathe will be your last!\n\nZuko: Think again! I am going to speak my mind and you are going to listen.\n\n",

"Aang: Where is he? Where is the Fire Lord?\n\nAzula:(sarcastically)Hm, you mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings.\n\n",

"Sokka:(brandishes his sword)Stop wasting our time and give us the information. You're powerless right now so you're in no position to refuse.\n\nToph: And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying.\n\n",

"Azula: Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar.(her face becomes completely expressionless)I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.\n\nToph: Okay you're good, I admit it. But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway.\n\n",

"Azula: When I left Ba Sing Se, I brought home some souvenirs. Dai Li agents.\n\nBato: Surround the periphery! We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over. Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives.\n\n",

"Tyro: Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.\n\nFire Nation Fighter #2: We'll never surrender. (eclipse occurs) Er okay, we surrender.\n\n",

"Hakoda: There it is. The Fire Nation royal palace. We've come so far.\n\nKatara: It's not over yet.\n\n",

"Zuko: For so long, all I wanted was you to love me. My father, who challenged me; a 13-year-old boy to an Agni Kai. How can you possibly justify a duel with a child?\n\nFire Lord Ozai: It was to teach you respect.\n\n",

"Zuko: It was cruel! And it was wrong.\n\nFire Lord Ozai: Then you have learned nothing.\n\n",

"Zuko: Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was.",


"Zuko: The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation! They hate us! And we deserve it. We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(laughs mocking)Your Uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?\n\nZuko:(closes his eyes for a second)Yes. He has.\n\n",

"Aang: I can't pin her down. She's too quick.\n\n",

"Sokka: Wait! Aang, Toph, stop attacking.(Aang, Toph, and Azula all stop running)Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!\n\nAzula:(sarcastically)Not true, I'm giving it my all.\n\n",

"Azula: Um, right. I think your friend just said that genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes.\n\nToph:(angry)I 'll roll your whole head!\n\n",

"Aang: Okay, so what do we do? Just ignore her?\n\nSokka: We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.\n\n",

"Azula: It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nSokka:(spreading one arm wide over his head in a gesture of dismissal)Ignore!\n\n",

"Azula: So, Sokka's your name right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her. Of course, you never came and she gave up on you.\n\nAzula: come and get it...\n\n",

"Sokka: Where is Suki?!\n\nZuko: After I leave here today, I'm going to free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm going to beg for his forgiveness. He is the one who has been a real father to me.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(chuckles sarcastically)That's just beautiful. Maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure.\n\nZuko: But I've come to an even more important decision.(pausesI'm going to join the Avatar. And I'm going to help him defeat you.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(grinning slyly)Really? Since you're a full blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless, you've got your\n\nZuko: Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.(sheathes his swords)Goodbye.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai:(standing)Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me but you'll only do it during an eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the Sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your Mother?\n\nAct III\n\n",

"Sokka:(angry)Where's Suki?! Answer me!\n\nAang:(grabbing Sokka's shoulder)Sokka, she won't talk.\n\n",

"Sokka:(hesitates, then turns back to Azula)Where are you keeping her?!\n\nFire Lord Ozai: Your Mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished.\n\n",

"Zuko:(a tear streams from his eye)So she's alive.\n\nFire Lord Ozai: Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. Your penalty will befarsteeper.\n\n",

"Azula: Oh. Sounds like the firebending's back on.\n\nAzula: Dad's all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to see you now.\n\n",

"Sokka: I fell for it! I used up all our time.\n\nToph: It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out.\n\n",

"Sokka:(hopeless)And now it's too late.\n\nAang: Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway.\n\n",

"Sokka: No. I don't think that's a good idea.\n\nAang: But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.\n\n",

"Toph: The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go help our friends.\n\nAang: I guess you guys are right.\n\n",

"Sokka:(putting a hand on Aang's shoulder)You'll have another chance. I know you will.\n\nBato:(off screen)What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?\n\n",

"Hakoda: I don't know. But now that the eclipse is over I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.\n\nThe Mechanist:(off screen)My own invention. Oh this is terrible!\n\n",

"Katara: They're back!\n\nSokka: It was all a trap. Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move.(he and Toph jump down from Appa)We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.\n\n",

"Aang:(off screen)They've got air power, but so do I!(opens his glider)I'm going to do what I can to slow them down.\n\nKatara: Appa, you and I can help too.\n\n",

"Sokka: Everyone, let's get back to the subs!\n\nKatara: We can't keep them all back. They're too many of them!\n\n",

"Aang: Let's join the others.\n\nZuko: Uncle!\n\n",

"Zuko: Where is my Uncle?\n\nWarden Poon:(shocked and awed)He's gone. He busted himself out. I... I've never seen anything like it! He was like a one man army!\n\n",

"Sokka: Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs.\n\nKatara: Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?\n\n",

"Aang: They're headed for the beach. They're going to destroy the submarines!\n\nSokka: How are we all going to escape?\n\n",

"Hakoda: We're not.\n\nSokka: Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win!\n\n",

"Hakoda: Yes, with the Avatar we could still win on another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.\n\nKatara: What? We can't leave you behind. We won't leave anyone behind.\n\n",

"Tyro: I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy but we'll get by.\n\nSokka: They're at the beach already!\n\n",

"The Mechanist: Bye, son.\n\nTeo:(sadly)Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you.\n\n",

"The Duke: I'll miss you, Pipsqueak.\n\nPipsqueak: Take care, The Duke.\n\n",

"Haru: I'll be back for you Dad.\n\nTyro: If we don't escape on our own first.\n\n",

"Hakoda: We lost today but we've never been this close. We tasted victory and that counts for something.\n\nKatara: We'll miss you Dad.\n\n",

"Sokka: Bye Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.\n\nAang: Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm going to make this up to you.\n\n",

"Captain: Should we follow them, Princess?\n\nAzula: No. They're too fast. It doesn't matter, they'll be back.\n\n",

"Sokka: Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation, (Katara turns her head towards her brother) or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?\n\nKatara: (She turns her head back) Both.\n\n",

"Aang: Sorry guys, but Appa (he stretches his hand out and affectionately scratches the area under Appa's eye) gets tired carrying all these people.\n\nTeo: I wonder how the rest of the troops are.\n\n",

"Haru: (Cut to a close up shot of Haru's face) They're probably on their way to a prison. Seems like my dad just got out, now he's going back in.\n\nThe Duke: I miss Pipsqueak.\n\n",

"Sokka: I miss not having blisters (Cut to an overhead shot behind Appa) on my feet.\n\nToph: Hey, we're here. I can feel it.\n\n",

"Katara:(off screen)Uh, I think your feet need their eyes checked.\n\nAang: (off screen) No, (Cut back to Aang with Sokka in the background) she's right, (Sokka looks up at Aang, stunned) we are here.\n\n",

"Toph: Wow, (Camera slowly pans down to rows of rocky protrusions)it's amazing.\n\nIroh: (off screen) What a stunning view.\n\n",

"Zuko: The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.\n\nIroh:  You know,  the Avatar hasn't been seen for a 100 years. The chances of finding him here are very slim. (Cut to a shot of Zuko's bandaged side)\n\n",

"Zuko: First, we'll check each of the air temples. Then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.\n\nIroh: Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. you should take some time to heal and rest.\n\n",

"Zuko: (turns around and raises his voice) What else would I expect to hear from thelaziestman in theFire Nation? (Cut to a close up of Iroh's slightly appalled face as he looks down and sighs) The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar. So I will.",

"Haru: (Haru runs into screen and waves a hand, beckoning the others to join him) Let's go check it out.\n\nKatara: You guys go... (Aang catches his glider and Katara lays a hand on his shoulder) I think we need to talk about some things.\n\n",

"Haru: I'll race you, Duke.\n\nThe Duke: (annoyed) I told you, it's \"The Duke.\"\n\n",

"Aang: Why can't I go?\n\nKatara: (Cut to a serious Katara) We need to decide what we're gonna do now. And since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.\n\n",

"Aang: Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?\n\nSokka: Well, if you ask me, thenewplan is theoldplan. You just need to master all four elements, and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.\n\n",

"Aang: (sarcastically) Oh, yeah, that's great. (He picks up a pebble and tosses it into the air nonchalantly) No problem, (He continues fidgeting)I'll just do that. (He lays the pebble on the benchand flicks it away.)\n\nKatara: Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy.\n\n",

"Aang: (continuing his little tantrum) Well, it's not even gonna be possible. Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?\n\nKatara: (deep in thought) We could look for Jeong Jeong.\n\n",

"Aang: Yeah right, (He lies down on the bench without a care) like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.\n\nToph: (Cut to a sideview of a confused Toph) Who's - Oh, (She folds her arms irritably) never mind. If it's important, I'll find out.\n\n",

"Aang: Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we (He jumps over Sokka's bench) just take a nice tour (He proceeds to run off screen as Momo follows him) around the temple?\n\nToph: (off screen) What's up with him? (Cut to the remaining 3)\n\n",

"Zuko: Well, what's your answer?!\n\nZuko: Yeah, that's what I'd say too. (Cut to a far shot of Zuko's campsite as he raises his arm to his head in despair) How am I supposed to convince these people I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? \n\n",

"Katara: Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?\n\nAang: (Cut to a close up of Aang as he feigns deaf) What? The wind is too loud in my ears. Check out this loop.\n\n",

"Toph: (Cut to a close up of Toph as she turns serious) I think that'll have to wait.\n\nZuko: (Cut to a close up of Zuko's face) Hello, (raises his arm up in greeting) Zuko here.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nZuko: Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so I just thought (raises his shoulders) I'd wait for you here.\n\n",

"Zuko: I know you must be surprised to see me here. (Cut to a sideview shot of the Gaang as they wear hostile expressions on their faces)\n\nSokka: Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.\n\n",

"Zuko: Right... Well, uh... anyway, what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I uh, I'm good now. And, well, I think I should join your group. Oh, and I can teach firebending... to you.\n\n",


"Katara: You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?\n\nSokka: Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down (Cut to a sideview shot of Zuko) and capture Aang.\n\n",

"Zuko: (defensive) I've done some good things. (walks forward) I mean, I could've stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. (He thrusts both arms out towards Appa to prove his point) That's something.\n\nToph: Appa does seem to like him. \n\n",

"Sokka: He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it.\n\nZuko: I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes (looks to the side in shame) in the past.\n\n",

"Sokka: (off screen) Like when you attacked our village?\n\nKatara: (off screen) Or when you stole my mother's necklace (Cut to a sideview of the siblings) and used it to track us down (she takes a step forward with her fists clenched) and capture us?\n\n",

"Zuko: Look, I admit I've done some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you. I'm gonna try to stop him.\n\n",


"Zuko: (Cut back to a slightly panicking Zuko) Well, that's not his name, but...\n\nSokka: (off screen) Oh,sorry. (Cut back to a frontal shot of Toph and Sokka as he remains in a defensive position) I didn't mean to insult your friend.\n\n",

"Zuko: (raising his voice) He's not my friend!\n\nToph(Cut to a visibly angry Toph)That guy (points an accusing finger at Zuko) locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us (swipes her hand down audibly) all up.\n\n",

"Zuko: Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you thought we could be (Zuko shrugs) friends. You know I have good in me.\n\nAang: There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. (Cut back to Zuko who listens intently) We'll never let you join us.",

"Katara: (off screen) You need to get out of here, now.\n\nZuko: I'm trying to explain  that I'm not that person anymore.\n\n",

"Sokka: Either you leave, or we attack.\n\nZuko: (aghast) If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to an angry Katara) No, we won't!\n\nKatara: (off screen) Get out of here and don't come back. And if we ever see you again...Well, (Sokka takes a step towards Zuko) we'd better not see you again!\n\n",

"Zuko: Argh, I can't believe how stupid I am. I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would've believed that. Stupid!\n\nKatara: Why would he try to fool us like that?\n\n",

"Sokka: Obviously, he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.\n\nKatara: This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother, and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.\n\n",

"Sokka: He wants you to trust him and feel sorry for him, so you let your guard down,thenhe strikes. (punches his fist out)\n\nKatara: The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt.",





"Katara: (off screen) Sokka, (Sokka turns towards his visibly annoyed sister as his uvula flaps around slightly) I looked at it and told you there was nothing there.\n\nSokka: (Cut back to a frontal shot of Sokka as he argues) I could feel it! It'smythroatal flap.\n\n",

"Aang: Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it wasZuko(the siblings turn towards him) who came in and got me out. (Cut to a close up of Aang's face) He risked his life to save me. \n\nKatara: No way, I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeah, (steps towards Aang) face it Aang. You're nothing but a big prize to him.\n\nAang: You're probably right.\n\n",

"Katara: And what was (punches her fists down again) all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? (crosses her arms once more) What a liar.\n\nToph:(off screen)Actually, he wasn't lying.\n\n",

"Toph: (off screen) I'm just saying that considering his messed-up family, and how he was raised, he could've turned out a lot worse. \n\nKatara: You're right, Toph, let's go find him and give him a medal. (She says this with sarcasm)", 

"Toph: (Cut to a sideview of Toph with her arms crossed) All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe (brings an arm up with her palm facing upwards) you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly.\n\n",





"Aang: Or when he tried to capture me (Cut back to Toph) at the fire temple. (Cut back to a frontal shot of the 3 again)\n\nKatara: Why would you (brings her hands up and throws them down rapidly in hot anger) eventryto defend him?\n\n",


"Sokka: You're darn right (Sokka takes a step towards his sister and it appears like a 3 versus 1 standoff) you're not, buddy.\n\nKatara: Well, (crosses her arms) I guess that's settled.\n\n",

"Toph: (Cut to a frontal shot of Toph's face as she groans in frustration and turns her back) I'm beginning to wonder who'sreallythe blind one (walks out of the chamber) around here.\n\nZuko: Who's there? Stay back.\n\n",

"Toph: (Cut to Toph as she earthbends a rock pillar in front of her as a form of protection from the fire) It's me! Ow!\n\nToph: You burned my feet!\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to Zuko as he gets off the ground) I'm sorry, it was a mistake! (proceeds to run off screen)\n\nToph: (Cut back to a frightened Toph as she uses her hands to push herself back) Get away from me!\n\n",

"Zuko: Let me (his hands are in a pleading gesture) help you. (Toph sends a chunk of earth back as he dodges it) I'm sorry.\n\nToph: Getoffme, (she turns around and pushes Zuko away) get off me!\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to a frontal shot of an apologetic Zuko) I didn't know it was you. (He tries to move forward but holds his side and grimaces in pain. Cut to Zuko's back view as Toph is seen crawling away.) Come back! Why am I so bad at being good?\n\nAct III\n\n",

"Katara:(passing the bowl to The Duke)Has anyone seen Toph?\n\nSokka: I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.\n\n",

"Haru: Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.\n\nKatara:(worried)I think we should go look for her.\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh, let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.\n\nThe Duke: We can go check for her.\n\n",

"Teo:(rolls in from off screen)Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel down to the hall of statues again. It'll work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.\n\nKatara: Toph, what happened?\n\n",

"Toph: My feet got burned.\n\nKatara:(examining Toph's feet)Oh, no, what happened?\n\n",

"Toph:(annoyed)I just told you, my feet got burned.\n\nKatara: I meant how.\n\n",

"Toph: Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night.\n\nAang:(shocked)You what!?\n\n",

"Katara:(shocked)Zuko?\n\nSokka:(shocked)Ugh!\n\n",

"Toph: I just thought he could be helpful to us. And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out.\n\nAang: So he attacked you?\n\n",

"Toph: Well, he did and he didn't. It was sort of an accident.\n\nAang: But hedidfirebend at you?\n\n",

"Toph: Yes.\n\nSokka: See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned... literally.\n\n",

"Katara:(cut to a close up of Toph's feet as Katara bends the water away and back into her water skin)It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. I wish I could've worked on them sooner.\n\nToph: Yeah, me too.\n\n",

"Sokka: Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.\n\nAang:(disappointed)I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.\n\n",

"Sokka: He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.\n\nToph:(Aang and Sokka take her arms and lift her up)Maybe just invite him back here. He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeah... get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner. Then we'll jump him andreallymake him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it.\n\nKatara: You are a master of surprise, Sokka.\n\n",

"Toph: Ahh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks.\n\nZuko:(off screen)Stop!(cut to a shot of Zuko walking towards Combustion Man as he stands back up)I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore.\n\n",

"Zuko:The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop!\n\nZuko: If you keep attacking, I won't pay you! All right, I'll pay you double to stop!\n\n",

"Toph:(urgent)He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side.\n\nKatara: I can't step out to waterbend at him without getting blown up. And I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.\n\n",

"Sokka:(thinks for a moment, then comes up with an idea)I know how to get an angle on him.\n\nSokka: All right buddy, don't fail me now.\n\n",

"Sokka:(jumps and catches the boomerang triumphantly)Yeah, boomerang! Aw, boomerang...\n\nAang: I can't believe I'm saying this... but thanks Zuko.\n\n",


"Zuko: Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.\n\nAang: Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's ok with them. Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?\n\n",

"Toph:(quiet for a second)Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.\n\nAang: Sokka?\n\n",

"Sokka:(closes his eyes and hangs his head a second, then shrugs)Hey, all I want is to defeat The Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then I'm all for it.\n\nAang: Katara?\n\n",

"Katara: I'll go along with whateveryouthink is right.\n\nZuko:(excitedly)I won't let you down, I promise.\n\n",

"Sokka: So here you go, home sweet home. I guess, you know, for now.(cut to a shot looking through the window of Zuko inside the bare room and Sokka looking in through the door)Unpack... lunch soon. Uh...welcome aboard? Yeah. Ok, this is really, really weird.",

"Iroh: You know, Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.",









"Aang: Ok. Not something to fear.\n\nZuko: But if you don't respect it, it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!\n\n",

"Zuko: Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.\n\nAang: Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?\n\n",

"Zuko:(Camera zooms up to show an aerial view of where they're standing)Good idea. You might want to take a couple steps back.\n\nZuko:(Zuko recoils back in confusion)What was that?! That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!\n\n",

"Aang:(looks to the floor)I thought it was,(looks back at Zuko)nice.(shrugs)\n\nZuko:(angrily)Why is this happening?!\n\n",

"Aang: Maybe it's the altitude.\n\nZuko:(turns away from Aang)Yeah, could be.(looks unsure and lost)\n\n",

"Zuko: Just breathe, and...(pauses to firebend again.)\n\nAang: That one kind of felt hot.\n\n",

"Zuko:(lashes out)Don't patronize me. You know what it's supposed to look like!(throws his hand out)\n\nAang: Sorry Sifu Hotman.\n\n",

"Zuko:(raises his arms and shouts)And stop calling me that!(Aang cringes)\n\nSokka: Hey,jerks. Mind if I watch you twojerksdo yourjerkbending?\n\n",

"Zuko: Get out of here!(makes a \"Get lost\" movement with his arm)\n\nSokka:(looking amused)Ok, take it easy.(drops his apple core, waves his hand in dismissal)I was just kidding around.(stands up to adjust his shirt)Jerk bending, still got it.\n\n",

"Zuko: Listen everybody;(everyone turns their head towards him)I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff.(drops his head dejectedly)\n\nToph:(cut to Toph who raises both arms to show she's innocent)Don't look at me. I didn't touch your stuff.(folds arms)\n\n",

"Zuko: I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone.\n\nKatara: I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know... how it would have been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago?\n\n",

"Zuko: Well it's not lost. It's just weaker for some reason.\n\nKatara:(holding up her bowl and glaring daggers at Zuko)Maybe you're just not asgoodas you think you are.\n\n",

"Toph: Ouch.\n\nZuko: I bet it's because I changed sides.\n\n",

"Katara: That's ridiculous.(drinks the contents in the bowl)\n\nAang: I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from\n\n",

"Sokka:(Cut to Sokka who enters comically into screen)So, all we need to do is make Zuko angry... easy enough.\n\nZuko:(bellows)Ok, cut it out! Look... even if you're right,I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.\n\n",

"Toph: You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending(Sokka enters the screen, rubbing his head)from a different source. I recommend\n\nSokka: How's he supposed to do that? By jumping into a volcano?\n\n",

"Toph:(swallows her food)No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.\n\nSokka: So is it jumping into a volcano?\n\n",

"Toph: I don't know. For earthbending,(Camera slowly zooms in on Toph's face)the original benders were badgermoles.\n\nToph:(voiceover)One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave.\n\n",

"Toph: That's where I met them.\n\nToph: They were blind, just like me,(The badgermole moves away from Toph and she attempts to crawl after it)so we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, not just as a martial art, but as an\n\n",

"Aang:(off screen)That's amazing, Toph. I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison.\n\nZuko: Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct.\n\n",

"Aang: What do you mean? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of\n\nZuko:(defensive)Well, they aren't around anymore, ok?\n\n",

"Aang: Ok, ok.(moves his arm around in an appeasing gesture)I'm sorry.\n\nZuko: But maybe there's another way.(walks towards the fountain)The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.\n\n",

"Aang: Sun Warriors? Well, I knowtheyweren't around when I was a kid.\n\nZuko: No, they died off thousands of years ago, but their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.\n\n",

"Aang: It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.\n\nSokka:(off screen)So, what? Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing where they stood 1000 years ago?\n\n",

"Zuko: More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher.(Aang looks worried)\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Zuko: We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.\n\nAang: Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude.\n\n",

"Zuko:(in a low voice)I can't believe this.(sighs and rests his head on the boat)\n\nAang: Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.\n\n",

"Zuko and Aang:Whoa!\n\nZuko:(off screen)Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them. I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these.\n\n",

"Aang:(off screen)Ok, we learned something about architecture. Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.\n\nAang: Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.\n\n",

"Zuko:(He kneels down and inspects the wire)I can't believe it. This booby trap must be centuries old, and it still works.\n\nAang: There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.\n\n",









"Zuko: They look pretty angry to me.(Cut to a close-up of the carving)\n\nAang: I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.\n\n",

"Zuko: Well, they had a funny way of showing it.(he looks away and takes a few steps before he's interrupted by Aang)\n\nAang: Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years. Something you're not telling me.\n\n",

"Zuko: My great-grandfather Sozin happened.\n\nZuko: He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. They were the ultimate firebenders. And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents\n\n",

"Aang: But I thought your Uncle was, I don't know, good?\n\nZuko: He had a complicated past. Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.\n\n",

"Aang: It's locked up.\n\nZuko: Wait. It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice.\n\n",

"Aang:(exasperated)Monkey feathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.\n\nZuko: No we can't.(unsheathes his broadsword and lays it in the path of the red beam.)But we might be able to speed time up. Let's see if we can outsmart the Sun Stone.\n\n",

"Aang: Nothing's happening.\n\nZuko:(Cut back to Zuko who is holding his sword in place)Come on...\n\n",

"Aang:(picking up his staff)You know, Zuko, I don't care(Zuko sheathes his sword)what everyone else says about you,(nudges him)you're pretty smart.\n\nZuko: Relax. They're just statues.\n\n",

"Aang:(scratches his head and reads the description at the foot of the statue)It says this is something called The Dancing Dragon.\n\nAang:(runs and grabs Zuko by his elbow)Zuko, get over here. I\n\n",

"Zuko:(he pulls back his arm in shock)What?\n\nAang: Just do it.(grabs and drags him away)\n\n",

"Aang: Let's follow the steps of the statues.\n\nAang: Don't you see?(Camera cuts to the top-view of the room)These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson.(both of them move in synchronization as he speaks)I think this is some kind of Sun\n\n",

"Zuko:(Zuko gets into punching position and move into another position with his arms spread in a low arc above his shoulders.)This better teach us some really good firebending.\n\nAang:(raises both arms in victory)Hurray! Wait.(rubs his head)What exactlyisthat?\n\n",

"Zuko: It's some kind of mystical gem stone.(runs towards the pedestal)\n\nAang: Well, don't touch it!(raises his arms as a warning and Zuko stops in his tracks)\n\n",

"Zuko: Why not?\n\nAang: Remember what happened out there with those spikes(looks at the side and raises his arms)I'm just very suspicious of giant, glowing gems sitting on pedestals.\n\n",

"Zuko: It feels almost alive.\n\nAang:(looks at the door closing)Oh, no, it's another trap!\n\n",

"Zuko: Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue.(struggles again)\n\nAang:(tries to budge the metal bars)I can't move. Zuko, do something!\n\n",

"Zuko: Me? I can't move either.\n\nAang: It stopped.\n\n",

"Zuko: At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm we can figure a way out of this.\n\nAang: You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?\n\n",

"Zuko: At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never\n\nAang:(opens his mouth widely)Help!\n\n",

"Zuko:Whoare you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries.\n\nAang: Well, what do you think we should do?\n\n",

"Zuko: Think about our place in the Universe?\n\nSun Warrior Chief: Who is down there?\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief: For trying to take our Sun Stone, you must be severely punished!\n\nZuko:(Cut to Zuko who still has a small spot of goo on his chin)We didn't come here to take your Sun Stone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.\n\n",

"Ham Gao:(Cut back to the top view and a man beside the Chief steps forward)Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves, here to steal Sun Warrior treasures.\n\nAang: Please, I don't normally play this card, but... I'm the Avatar.\n\n",

"Aang: Just hear us out.\n\nZuko: My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. Or at least, I\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief:(cut to the Chief's face, the camera slowly zooms in)If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters Ran and Shao.\n\nAang: Ran and Shao? There are two of them?\n\n",


"Sun Warrior Chief:(sternly)No.(turns back to the fire.)\n\nSun Warrior Chief: This ritual illustrates the essence of Sun Warrior\n\n",

"Zuko: Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small. You're too timid. Give it more juice.\n\nAang:(climbs up and looks worriedly at Zuko)But what if I can't control it?\n\n",

"Zuko: You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid.\n\nSun Warrior Chief:(walks towards them)Facing the judgment of the\n\n",

"Ham Gao:(places his hand on his hip, trying to intimidate Zuko)I know I wouldn't be.\n\nAang:(interrupts)But once they find out I'm the Avatar...\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief: Have you forgotten that you vanished allowing the Fire\n\nAang: We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we hoped.(shows Zuko that he can handle his fire and gives a weak smile)\n\n",

"Zuko: No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them.\n\nAang: What if they judge us and attack us?\n\n",

"Zuko: Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar. I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. \n\nZuko: Bring 'em out.\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief:(opens his hand to the side)Chanters!\n\nSun Warrior: (using a megaphone-like object to amplify his voice)Those who wish to meet the masters Ran and Shao will now present their fire.\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief:(off-screen)Sound the call.\n\nAang:What's happening?\n\n",

"Aang:(whispers)Zuko, my fire went out.\n\nZuko:(whispers back)What do you wantmeto do?\n\n",

"Aang: Give me some of yours.(He reaches for Zuko's fire and Zuko gently pushes him back)\n\nZuko: No, just make your own.\n\n",

"Aang:(irritated)Quit being stingy!\n\nAang and Zuko: Uh-oh.\n\n",

"Zuko: These are the masters.\n\nAang:(whispers)You still think we can take 'em?\n\n",

"Zuko: Shh. I never said that.\n\nHam Gao: Oh, here it comes.(looks up at the boys)Any moment now... dinner for the masters.\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief:(turns his head towards Ham Gao and chides)Quiet, Ham Gao.\n\nHam Gao: What?(sulks and turns his head away)Everyone's thinking it.\n\n",

"Aang:(whispers)Zuko, I think we're supposed to do The Dragon Dance with them.\n\nZuko: What? What about this situation that you think they want us to dance?\n\n",

"Aang: Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it.\n\nZuko: Fine.\n\n",

"Zuko:(realization) I understand.\n\nZuko: Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.\n\nAang: Like firebending harmony.\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief: Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending.\n\nZuko: I can't believe there are still living dragons. My Uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.\n\n",



"Aang: All this time, I thought Firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is. It's energy and life.\n\n",

















"Zuko: Yeah. It's like the Sun, but inside of you. Do you guys realize this? \n\nSun Warrior Chief: Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors... so yeah.\n\n",

"Sun Warrior Chief: Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence,(his face suddenly turns serious)we have no choice but to imprison you here forever. Just kidding.\n\n",




"Zuko:(defensive)It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.\n\nSokka: We'll just tap-dance(moves his fingers in a dancing motion)our way to victory over the Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Zuko:(walks towards Sokka)It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!\n\nKatara: Oh yeah? What's yourlittleform called?\n\n",



"Act I\n\nZuko: (Cut to a tray full of tea cups with Zuko's hand holding a kettle and filling up the empty cups) No one can make tea like Uncle. (Camera pans up to Zuko's face) But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?\n\n",

"Katara: Sure. (Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire)\n\nAang: I like jokes.\n\n",

"Toph: Bring it. \n\nZuko:Okay. (Cut to Zuko kneeling between The Duke and Haru) Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line (the boys help themselves to the tea) is, \"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed.\" Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.\n\n",

"Katara: Right. Maybe that's because he remembers (grabs a cup) the whole thing.\n\nToph: It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. (Zuko walks between Toph and Teo and hands them their drinks.) It hardly ever happens. (They proceed to drink their tea)\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to Sokka who is sitting by himself at the side, thinking) Hey, can I talk to you for a second?\n\nZuko: So (Appa wakes up and looks at them) what's up?\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to the side view of the area as they continue to walk further into the dark) If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?\n\nZuko: What do you mean? Who was captured?\n\n",

"Sokka: When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where (gestures both hands out) they might be.\n\nZuko: I can't tell you.\n\n",

"Sokka: What? Why not?\n\nZuko: Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. (He turns around and Sokka grabs his shoulder)\n\n",

"Sokka: It's my Dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him\n\nZuko: It's not good Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka: Please.\n\nZuko: (closes his eyes) My guess is...(opens his eyes)They were taken to the Boiling Rock.\n\n",

"Sokka: (frowns slightly) What's that?\n\nZuko: (off screen) The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. (Sokka's mouth goes slightly agape) It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's inescapable.\n\n",

"Sokka: So where is this place?\n\nZuko: Why do you need to know? What are you planning?\n\n",

"Sokka: Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid. (waves his arm dismissively)\n\nZuko: (warily) It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.\n\n",

"Sokka: Thanks Zuko. (yawns and pats Zuko's shoulder as he walks past) Just knowing makes me feel better.\n\nZuko:Yeah, I'm sure it does.\n\n",

"Zuko: Not up to anything, huh?\n\nSokka: Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my Dad. (puts back his belongings back into his bag) You happy now?\n\n",

"Zuko: I'm never happy.\n\nSokka: Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan wasmyidea. It was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko.\n\n",




"Zuko: You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.\n\nSokka: (Sokka climbs up near the saddle)No. I have to do this alone.\n\n",

"Zuko: How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, (Cut to a back view of Sokka) prisons don't have bison day cares.\n\nZuko: We'll take my war balloon.\n\n",


"Aang: Nobody else has homework. (Cut to an overhead view of Aang as he proceeds to squat with his hands behind his head) One hot squat. Two hot squat. Three hot squat. Four hot...\n\nSokka: (looks up) Pretty clouds.\n\n",

"Zuko: (raises head) Yeah, fluffy.\n\nZuko: (turns towards Sokka) What?\n\n",

"Sokka: What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.\n\nZuko: No kidding.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yep. A balloon. But for War.\n\nZuko: There's one thing my Dad's good at, (turns back to the tank and firebends) it's War.\n\n",

"Sokka: (nonchalantly) Yeah, it seems to run in the family.\n\nZuko: Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.\n\n",

"Sokka: I know, I know, you've changed.\n\nZuko: I meant my Uncle. He was more of a Father (Cut to Zuko who looks saddened) to me. And I really let him down.\n\n",

"Sokka: (emphatically)I think your Uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard.\n\nZuko: It wasn't that hard.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to a side view of the basket) Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?\n\nZuko: Well I did have a girlfriend. Mai.\n\n",

"Sokka: (He goes closer to Zuko with a surprised look on his face) That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?\n\nZuko: (Cut back to show Zuko grinning goofily) Yeah. (his face turns serious) Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut back to Sokka who leans back on the basket) My first girlfriend turned into the Moon.\n\nZuko: (looks up) That's rough buddy.\n\n",

"Zuko: There it is.\n\nZuko: There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.\n\n",

"Zuko: We're going down. The balloon's not working anymore!\n\nSokka: The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly.\n\n",

"Zuko: So what are we supposed to do?\n\nSokka: (Cut back to Sokka who grabs onto the tank) I don't know. Crash landing?\n\n",

"Zuko: How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?\n\nSokka: We'll figure something out. I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.\n\n",

"Zuko: (looks at Sokka as he walks away) You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?\n\nSokka: (Cut to a back view of Sokka walking towards the fallen vent) My Dad might be here. I had to come and see.\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle always said I never thought things through, but this, ugh, (grabs his head)this is just crazy. \n\nSokka: (Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place. And for the record, I always think things through. But my plans haven't exactly worked",



"Zuko: What are you doing?\n\nSokka: It doesn't work anyway. (Cut to an area behind their heads as both of them look at the vent slowly going underwater) And we don't want anyone to find it.\n\n",

"Zuko: I hope you know what you're doing. (Both of them turn around) There's no turning back now.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Zuko: I hope these disguises work.\n\nSokka: We just need to lay low and find my Dad as soon as possible.\n\n",

"Guard: (stopping at the opening of the corridor to address the 2 boys) Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard, come on.\n\nChit Sang: I didn't do anything. I'm going back to my cell.\n\n",

"Bully Guard: Stop right there Chit Sang.\n\nSokka: (whispers) We can't blow our cover. (Cut back to a front show of Chit Sang as the guard approaches him from behind)\n\n",

"Bully Guard: I've had it with your unruly behavior.\n\nChit Sang: (turns back to the guard) What did I do?\n\n",

"Bully Guard: (Cut to the guard) He wants to know what he did. (turns towards Zuko and Sokka) Isn't that cute? \n\nZuko: (Sokka's eye looks toward Zuko nervously) Uh, yeah, very cute sir.\n\n",

"Sokka: Super cute.\n\nBully Guard: You didn't bow down when I walked by Chit Sang.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: (outraged) What? That's not a prison rule.\n\nBully Guard: (Cut to an overhead shot of the guard staring up at Chit Sang) Do it.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: (Cut back to Chit Sang who protests defiantly) Make me.\n\nBully Guard: (shakes head) Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. (Cut back to Chit Sang who still remains in his stance) You're going in the Cooler. You! Help me take him in.\n\n",

"Sokka: (whispers to Zuko) Meet back here in an hour.\n\nBully Guard: The Warden will deal with you soon.\n\n",

"Bully Guard: Can you believe this guy?\n\nSokka: (gets into the act) Prisoners. Am I right?\n\n",

"Bully Guard: Ugh. Tell me about it.\n\nMale Guard: (Camera zooms out to the buffet table as Zuko grabs his food) Hey new guy. I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times but this is the lounge. Relax.\n\n",

"Zuko: But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared someone could\n\nFemale Guard: Give it a week, he'll loosen up.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Sets his plate down and sits with them) Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?\n\nFemale Guard: (Cut to the guard) No, you can't date the female guards.\n\n",

"Male Guard: (Camera pans to the left to the male guard) Trust me, you don't want to. \n\nZuko: No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right? So what about war prisoners?\n\n",

"Sokka: It sure looks cold in there.\n\nBully Guard: That's why we call itthe Cooler. (Cut back to Chit Sang who continues to shiver)He won't be firebending in there. (looks at the end of the corridor and suddenly pulls down his visor) It's the Warden. Look alive.\n\n",

"Warden: So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better.\n\nChit Sang: (shivers and struggles to talk) I wasn't trying to escape.\n\n",

"Zuko: Hey there, fellow guard. How goes it?\n\nSokka: (raises his visor) Zuko?\n\n",

"Zuko: (raises his finger to his mouth) Shh. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no (makes the gesture with his hands) Water\n\nSokka: (Cut back to Sokka who is in shock) What? Are you sure? Did you double check?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut back to Zuko) Yeah, I'm sure.\n\nSokka: (Cut to an area on the ground behind Zuko) No. (holds his head in despair as he walks towards a wall) No! (bangs his fist against the wall in frustration)\n\n",

"Zuko: I'm really sorry Sokka.\n\nSokka: So we came all this way for nothing. I failed. (leans on the wall) Again.\n\n",


"Zuko: That's the spirit. I can't believe (folds his arms) that worked. I didn't even know what I was saying.\n\nSokka: No, what you said made no sense at all. But look, (points) it's Suki! \n\n",

"Guard:(off screen)Prisoners! (a bell rings through the yard as Suki gets up) Back in your cells!\n\nSuki: (sits up and camera zooms out to show Sokka standing in front of her) What is it? (sits up straight on her bed, looking at him) Did I do something wrong?\n\n",

"Sokka: (crosses his arms) You mean you don't recognize me?\n\nSuki: You people all look the same to me. (looks to the side)\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut back to Sokka who looks on smugly) Oh. Then maybe you'll recognize this.\n\nSuki: Sokka, (runs to him) it's you.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to a side view of both of them standing up) The other\n\nSuki: No, (looks worried) I don't know where they are. They locked me here because I'm the leader.\n\n",

"Sokka: Well, you (touches her face with one hand) won't be here for long, I'm busting you out.\n\nSuki: (Cut to Suki) I'm so glad (holds on to Sokka's hand that is touching her face) to see you Sokka. I knew you'd come.\n\n",

"Female Guard: 'Scuse me, I need to get into that cell.\n\nZuko: No, you can't go in there. (looks into the opening of the cell door) The lights are out... the prisoner (points to the door) could sneak up on you. (Cut to the female guard who frowns)\n\n",


"Sokka: You're under arrest! (Helps Zuko to his feet and whispers) Don't worry, I'll figure it out.\n\nWarden: Well, well, well. (Cut to the warden) I never thought I'd find you in here,Prince Zuko.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut back to Zuko's side view) How did you know who I am?\n\nWarden: How could I not? (furrows his eyebrows) You broke my niece's heart. (Cut to a side view of the scene to show Zuko leaning dismissively against the wall.)\n\n",


"Zuko: So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my Father and collect the reward.\n\nWarden: (darkly) Oh in due time believe me, I intend to collect.\n\n",

"Sokka: (crosses arms)Oh, good. You guys have met.\n\nSuki: (Camera zooms out to show Suki and Zuko doing their chores) A...actually, we met a long time ago.\n\n",

"Zuko: We did?\n\nSuki: Yeah, you kind of burned down my village. (looks at Zuko angrily as Sokka puts his hand on his helmet in a \"You shouldn't have said that\" gesture)\n\n",

"Zuko: Yeah...\n\nSokka: So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well to keep the cold in it also has to keep the heat out, right?\n\n",

"Suki: Just get to the point Sokka.\n\nSokka: It's a perfect boat (he left arm moves across his body in a fluid motion) for getting through the boiling water.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to Zuko and Suki who look at each other sceptically) The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?\n\nSokka: (Cut back to Sokka) I'm telling you, it'll work.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: (off screen) Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out? \n\nSokka: (panics) What? (making various gestures) We didn't. We... We didn't say that. (waves arm dismissively)\n\n",

"Zuko: Yeah, you heard wrong.\n\nChit Sang: I heard you hatching an escape plan and I want in.\n\n",

"Zuko: There's nothing to get in on.\n\nSokka: Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is... an egg? (Zuko and Suki sigh at Sokka's lame attempt to hide the truth)\n\n",

"Chit Sang: Ok, well, I come with you or the Warden (Camera pans from Zuko to Suki who have serious looks on their faces) hears about thiseggtoo.\n\nSuki: (looks to Sokka) I guess we have no choice.\n\n",

"Sokka: Okay, you're in. Now, first we need someone (he reaches to his pocket) to unbolt the Cooler. (he hands a wrench over to Zuko) From the inside. (Zuko puts it into his pocket)\n\nChit Sang: (Cut to Chit Sang) Oh, I can get you inside.\n\n",



"Guard: No firebending. (points) Into the cooler.\n\nSokka: I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.\n\n",

"Zuko: (lifts his head up and sighs a breath of fire) Yes, I have. Completely.\n\nSokka: (smiles and lifts his visor up as he whispers) I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.\n\n",

"Zuko: Someone's coming.\n\nMale Guard: (Cut to 2 guards making their rounds around the cooler corridor)Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn.\n\n",

"Female Guard: Anybody interesting?\n\nMale Guard:  Nah, just the usual. Some robbers,couple of traitors, some war prisoners. Though I did hear there might be a pirate.\n\n",






"Female Guard: No foolin'.\n\nZuko: (Cut to a concerned Zuko) War prisoners. It could be your Father.\n\n",

"Sokka: I know. (looks away and closes his eyes)\n\nZuko: Well, what should (shrugs)we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?\n\n",

"Sokka: (shakes head) I don't know. (looks towards Zuko with tears in his eyes) Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom? All of our\n\nZuko: It's your call Sokka.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: Took you guys long enough. This here's (Cut to show a girl waving at them and a guy waiting near the shore) my girl and my best buddy. They're coming too.\n\nSokka: Fine, everybody in the cooler. Let's go.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to a side view of the scene as Suki and Zuko look on) Are you sure you want to go? (walks to Sokka as he slings his sword) You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your Dad is your chance.\n\nSuki: Your Dad?\n\n",

"Sokka: If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.\n\nZuko: (Cut back to Zuko) No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.\n\n",

"Sokka: (stands up as he slings is bag over his shoulder while raising his eyebrows) That's supposed to make me feel better? (walks away)\n\nZuko: Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again. (Sokka stops in his tracks)\n\n",

"Sokka: Seriously, not helping.\n\nZuko: (grabs Sokka's shoulder) You have totryevery time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: (off screen) Hey, (Cut to Chit Sang holding onto the cooler) if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?\n\nSokka: No, I'm staying.  You've been here long enough.\n\n",

"Suki: (grabs his hand reassuringly) I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.\n\nZuko: (comes into screen) I'm staying too.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: Not me, I'm out. Let's roll baby. (he pushes the cooler and jumps into it)\n\nSokka: (Cut to inside the cooler looking at the trio as they shrink in the distance) We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: Argh, this current is so slow. (Cut back out into the water to show Chit Sang tearing off a small, metal, rectangular section of the cooler) I can use this to paddle.\n\nWarden: Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners. Now!\n\n",

"Sokka: The plan failed! They're caught.\n\nWarden: Get the fugitives and throw them in the Cooler!\n\n",

"Guard: (The guard in charge of the steering wheel turns towards the warden) Uh, they are in the cooler sir.\n\nWarden: (raises his voice towards the guard) One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown!\n\n",

"Sokka: The gondola's moving.\n\nSokka: This is it.\n\n",

"Sokka: If my Dad's not there, we risked everything for nothing.\n\nSuki: We had to.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to a close up of Sokka's anxious face) Come on, come on.\n\nZuko: (off screen) Is that him?\n\n",

"Sokka: (looks back at Zuko) My Dad doesn't have a nose ring.\n\nSokka: (Cut back to Sokka's blue eye staring up at the scene) Where is he?\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut back to Sokka who is looking on with disbelief)That's it? That can't be it.\n\nSuki: I'm sorry Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka: Oh no. (lowers his head in dismay)\n\nGuard: (off screen) Hey you, (Sokka opens his eyes and the trio look up) get off (Cut to the line of guards in front of the gondola as the guard points to a person inside) the gondola.\n\n",













"Hakoda: (His eyes looks to the side) No.\n\nWarden: (Cut to an area behind Hakoda) Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes? Then take a look!\n\n",

"Warden: I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong willed. But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye.\n\nWarden: See? Isn't that better. You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all...\n\n",

"Guard: Are you okay, Sir?\n\nWarden: (lashes out) I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!\n\n",

"Sokka: Thank goodness you're okay. (walks towards his Father)\n\nHakoda: (stands up on the mattress rapidly with his fist out in an attacking position) If you take one step closer you'll see just how okay I am.\n\n",

"Sokka: (lifts his visor) Dad, it's me. (points to self)\n\nHakoda: (lowers his arm and tears up) Sokka, my son.\n\n",

"Hakoda: You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut.\n\nSokka: Yeah, (rubs his neck) I ran into that problem earlier.\n\n",

"Warden: Are you comfortable Chit Sang?\n\nChit Sang: (Cut to Chit Sang as the warden walks around him) If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it. I'm not a squealer.\n\n",

"Warden: (Cut to back of the warden's head as he turns it slightly to look at his prisoner) Chit Sang, I only asked you if you were comfortable.\n\nChit Sang: Well, yeah. (smiles) Actually, I am pretty comfortable.\n\n",

"Warden: Are you still comfortable?\n\nChit Sang: (his eyes look up) No.\n\n",

"Hakoda: The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. But before I left I met some young women who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?\n\nSokka: You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?\n\n",

"Hakoda: That's right.\n\nSokka: Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Good, (lays a hand on his son's shoulder) we'll need all the help we can get.\n\nSokka: And you know Prince Zuko?\n\n",

"Hakoda: The son of the Firelord? I don't know him, but I knew of him.\n\nSokka: Well, he's here too.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Sounds like a major problem.\n\nSokka: Actually, he's on our side now. I know, I had the same reaction. After all he has done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself and I never would have found you without his help.\n\n",



















"Hakoda: So, do you have a plan?\n\nSokka: We had one (looks away) but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. (sets  his head on his knees) I don't know if\n\n",

"Hakoda: Sokka, (pats his son's back) there's no prison in the World that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.\n\nSokka: Then we'd better find two.\n\n",

"Sokka: Zuko, are you there?\n\nZuko: (Zuko's eyes appear at the door's opening) I'm here.\n\n",

"Sokka: I just got done talking to my Dad. We came up with an escape plan together.\n\nMale Guard:(off screen)What (Sokka startles) are\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to an area behind the 2 guards) I was just (pointing to the door) telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!\n\nMale Guard: (Cut to the 2 guards who look serious) Well, you'll have to do that later, he's coming with us.\n\n",

"Sokka:(looks to Zuko's cell door and back) Why?\n\nFemale Guard: (arms akimbo) Because we have orders straight from the Warden. That's why.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut back to Sokka who smiles) Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? (punches his right fist into his left palm)\n\nFemale Guard: (crosses her arms and leans against the railing) Fine, ten seconds.\n\n",

"Sokka: (off screen) Take that! And this!\n\nMale >Guard: (the female guard shakes her head) Newbie.\n\n",

"Sokka: (whispers as he punches) We have a new plan but it's gonna need a big distraction.\n\nMale Guard: (Cut to an area deep in the room to show the 2 guards entering) Alright, that's enough.\n\n",

"Zuko: What are you doing? Where are you taking me?\n\nZuko: I didn't do anything wrong.\n\n",

"Mai: (off screen) Come on (Zuko looks to the source of the voice) Zuko. (Cut to show Mai with her head down at the corner of the room) We all know (looks up and walks into the light) that's a lie.\n\nZuko: (Cut back to Zuko's surprised face) Mai.\n\n",

"Warden: How is he? (Cut to the 2 guards who are holding Chit Sang's chair upside down. Chit Sang is red in the face as blood rushes to his head due to gravity.)\n\nGuard: I think he's ready to talk.\n\n",

"Warden: (bends his head to Chit Sang's shoulder) Have you had enough time tothinkabout what I asked?\n\nChit Sang: Yes.\n\n",

"Warden: And?\n\nChit Sang: You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan.\n\n",

"Warden: (places a hand on Chit Sang's shoulder) Who?\n\nChit Sang: It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard, only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nZuko: How did you know I was here?\n\n",

"Mai: (Cut to Mai who looks angry) Because I know you so well.\n\nZuko: (he looks up to her) But... how?\n\n",

"Mai: (Cut to Mai who looks to the side) The Warden's my Uncle you idiot. (Cut to Zuko who brings his hand to his forehead and groans) The\n\nZuko: (Cut to Zuko who looks at her apologetically) I didn't mean to...\n\n",

"Mai: (interrupts) You didn't mean to? (she walks behind Zuko to read out the contents of the letter) Dear Mai, I'm sorry that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.\n\nZuko: (harshly) Stop! This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Mai: Thanks Zuko. That makes me feel all better. (she throws the letter at his head. Zuko grabs his head and rubs the spot she threw the letter at.)\n\nZuko: Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. But I have to do this to save my country.\n\n",

"Mai: Save it? You're betraying your country.\n\nZuko: (Cut back to Zuko) That's not how I see it.\n\n",




"Suki: That's great.\n\nSokka: Yeah and we're escaping today. On the gondola.\n\n",

"Suki: (confused) What?\n\nSokka: My dad and I came up with a plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and (places both hands on Suki's shoulders) we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.\n\n",

"Suki: (lowers Sokka's arms) We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.\n\nSokka: My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.\n\n",

"Suki: Okay. Let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The Warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.\n\nSokka: Not if the Wardenisthe captive. I have to go. I'll find you before we start the riot.\n\n",










"Male Guard: (off screen) Hey you!(Sokka freezes as 2 guards walk into screen) The Warden wants to see you. (points to Sokka)\n\nSokka: (turns back) Why?\n\n",

"Male Guard: I don't know. I didn't ask.\n\nSokka: Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? (he walks off)\n\n",

"Male Guard: He wants to see you, (Sokka comes back on screen as 2 other guards hold his hands behind his back and leads him away) now.\n\nWarden: Put him in the line up.\n\n",

"Warden: One of you is an imposter who thought (Cut to the warden)\n\nChit Sang: (off screen) That's him, (Sokka opens his eyes and is surprised) Warden. (Camera pans to the left to show Chit Sang pointing at the bully guard) He's the imposter.\n\n",

"Bully Guard: (Cut to the bully guard who is outraged) What? (Cut to the warden who smiles. Cut back to the bully guard who grabs Chit Sang by his shirt) I am not. He's lying!  He's a liar!\n\nBully Guard: I'm telling you, it wasn't me.\n\n",

"Warden: Save your breath. I know you've been working together. (The warden comes close to the guard's face) You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.\n\nBully Guard: That was just a coincidence.\n\n",

"Guard: (the door opens and a voice sounds off screen) Sir, there's someone to see you.\n\nWarden: (turns his head to the door) Who told you to interrupt me! (it was Azula)\n\n",

"Azula: I did. (Ty Lee can be seen behind her)\n\nWarden: (Cut to Azula with her arms akimbo, amused) Princess Azula. Uh, it is an honor (Azula and Ty Lee walk into the room) to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. I didn't realize you were coming.\n\n",

"Azula: (walks in some more) Who is this?\n\nWarden: (Cut to the guard who looks at the warden and then looks away) He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.\n\n",

"Bully Guard: It wasn't me. (Cut to an area behind the guard's head)\n\nWarden: Quiet you. (points to the guard)\n\n",

"Azula: You're wasting your time. (turns and walks to the door) That's not one of them.\n\nWarden: (stunned) How do you know?\n\n",

"Azula: (Cut to Azula) Because I'm a people person.\n\nSokka: (He enters the screen) Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.\n\n",

"Guard: (crosses arms) But we're in the middle of lockdown.\n\nSokka: Oh, okay. I'll just go tell the Warden you said that. I'm sure he'll begladto hear about you undermining his authority.  What's your name again? \n\n",











"Guard: Wait. Don't tell the Warden, I... I'm just a little confused.\n\nSokka: Hey, I'm confused too. But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational. So if you ask me, it's best not to question it and just do what he\n\n",

"Guard: Yeah, you're right. (Cut to his hands pulling down the various levers as a bell rings off) We're letting them out.\n\nSokka: This is it. We have to start a riot.\n\n",

"Suki: Okay, but how do we do that?\n\nHakoda: I'll show you.\n\n",

"Prisoner: Hey, why did you do that for? That hurt my feelings.\n\nHakoda: (Cut to a side view of the \"confrontation\") Aren't you mad at me?\n\n",

"Prisoner: Uhh, well normally I would be, but I've been working to control my anger. (Cut back to Sokka who looks on with disbelief)\n\nSokka: This isn't working.\n\n",




"Prisoner: Forget about controlling my anger. Let's riot!\n\nWarden: Who let these prisoners into the yard? This is supposed to be a lockdown!\n\n",

"Guard: Ma'am, there's a riot going on. I'm here to protect you.\n\nMai: (Cut to the back of Mai's head as she turns around) I don't need any protection.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Zuko laughs slightly) Hah, believe me. She doesn't.\n\nGuard: (Cut to the  guard walking into the room) I'm sorry but I'm under direct orders (Cut to Zuko who looks serious) from your Uncle to make sure nothing happens.\n\n",

"Mai: Get off of me!\n\nSokka: Zuko, good. We're all here. Now all we need to do (points to the top of another tower) is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas.\n\n",

"Zuko: And how do we do that?\n\nSokka: (looks back at Zuko) I'm not sure.\n\n",

"Zuko: Argh, I thought you thought this through.\n\nSokka: (in hysterics) I thought you told me it's okay not to think\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut side view shot of the argument. Zuko has his fists clenched.) Maybe not everything. But this is kind of important.\n\nChit Sang: Hey, uhh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.\n\n",

"Warden: You wouldn't dare.\n\nSuki: Sorry Warden, (she tightens the tie and lets go) you're my prisoner now.\n\n",

"Suki: We've got the Warden, now let's get out of here.\n\nHakoda: (holds his stomach) That's some girl.\n\n",

"Sokka: (looks at Suki) Tell me about it.\n\nAct III\n\n",

"Suki: (turns back to Sokka) We're almost there.\n\nZuko: Back off, we've got the Warden.\n\n",

"Zuko: Let's go.\n\nSuki: Everyone in.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut back to inside the gondola) What are you doing?\n\nZuko: I'm making it so they can't stop us.\n\n",

"Sokka: Way to think ahead.\n\nSuki: We're on our way.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Wait. Who's that?\n\nZuko: (off screen) That's a problem. (the guards proceed to bow in respect) It's my sister and her friend.\n\n",

"Suki: This is a rematch I've been waiting for.\n\nZuko: Me too.\n\n",

"Guard #1: (off screen) There's the Warden. I see him!\n\nWarden: Cut the line!\n\n",

"Guard #2: (Cut to the back view of the guard with the telescope as 2 other guards run into screen) He wants us to cut the line.\n\nGuard #3: But if we cut the line, there's no way he'll survive.\n\n",

"Guard #1: (brings down the telescope) He knows that.\n\nTy Lee: They're about to cut the line!\n\n",

"Azula: (Cut back to Azula's face) Then it's time to leave. Goodbye Zuko.\n\nZuko: They're cutting the line. The gondola's about to go!\n\n",

"Hakoda: I hope this thing floats.\n\nGuard: What are you doing?!\n\n",

"Mai: (Cut to Mai) Saving the jerk who dumped me.\n\nSokka: (Cut to a front shot of Sokka who looks out of the opening) Who is that?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to a shocked Zuko) It's Mai.\n\nAzula: (Cut to a furious Azula) What is she doing?!\n\n",

"Hakoda: (Cut to the back of Hakoda's head looking at the warden lying on the floor) Sorry Warden, your record is officially broken.\n\nSuki: Well, we made it out. Now what?\n\n",

"Sokka: (Sokka stops and looks back at Zuko who pauses in his tracks, thinking) Zuko, what are you doing?\n\nZuko: My sister was on that island.\n\n",

"Sokka: Yeah and she's probably right behind us. So let's not stop.\n\nZuko: What I mean is she must have come here somehow. (He runs to the edge of the rocks and looks down) There. That's our way out of here.\n\n",

"Azula: (off screen) Leave us alone.\n\nAzula: (Cut back to Azula) I never expected this from you.\n\n",

"Azula: The thing I don't understand is why (lifts her head up) Why would you do it? You know the consequences.\n\nMai: I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. (Cut back to Azula) I love Zuko more than I fear you.\n\n",

"Azula: (outburst) No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more!\n\nTy Lee: Come on, (pulls Mai's arm) let's get out of here!\n\n",

"Azula: (Camera pans to Azula on the floor as she glares at them furiously) You're both fools.\n\nGuard: What shall we do with them, princess?\n\n",

"Azula: (Azula's head comes into screen) Put them somewhere. I'll never have to see their faces again. And let them rot.\n\nKatara: What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to Zuko) It kind of got destroyed.\n\nAang: (Cut back to the welcoming party) Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.\n\n",

"Toph: Did you at least get some good meat?\n\nSokka: (Cut to a close up of Sokka) I did. (closes his eyes) The best meat of all. (opens his eyes)The meat of friendship and fatherhood.\n\n",

"Chit Sang: (waves) I'm new. What's up everybody?\n\nKatara: (Cut to Katara who tears up) Dad. (she runs towards her Father)\n\n",

"Hakoda: (Cut back to Hakoda) Hi, Katara.\n\nKatara: (Cut to Sokka's back as he looks on. Katara lets go) How are you here? What is going on? (looks at her brother) Where did you go?\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to Sokka) We... kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.\n\nToph: (Cut to an overhead view of the scene as the camera slowly zooms out) Seriously, you guys didn't find any meat?\n\n",


"Act I\n\nZuko: (pushing her out of the way) Watch out!\n\n",

"Katara: What are you doing?!\n\nZuko: Keeping rocks from crushing you.\n\n",

"Katara: Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now.\n\nZuko: I'll take that as a thank you.\n\n",

"Toph: (turns back and points to the tunnel) Come on, we can get out through here!\n\nAang: What are you doing?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Camera zooms out to show Zuko isn't evacuating) Go ahead, I'll hold them off. I think this is a family visit.\n\nAang: (Cut back to Aang who looks on, stunned) Zuko, no!\n\n",

"Sokka: (grabs Aang's shoulder) Come on, we gotta get out of here.\n\nZuko: (Cut to Zuko and camera slowly zooms out on him) What are you doing here?\n\n",

"Azula: (Cut to Azula) You mean it's not obvious yet (opens  her arms out) I'm about to celebrate becoming an only child!\n\nAang: (Cut to a side view of the 3 outside the tunnel as they tug the reins to no avail) I can't get him to go in there. Appa hates tunnels.\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to a close up of Katara as their arms tremble against Appa's resistance) Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.\n\nAang: We'll have to finda way. (they loosen their hold on the reins)\n\n",

"Sokka: We need to split up. (runs towards the group in the tunnel) Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.\n\nKatara: (Cut to Katara who turns her head back) No, the Fire Nation can't separate our family again.\n\n",

"Hakoda: (places his hands on her shoulders) It'll be okay, it's not forever.\n\nToph: (Cut to an area on the ground looking at Appa as Aang climbs onto his horns onto his head) I can clear that away and we can fly out through there.\n\n",

"Suki: (Cut to the inside of the saddle as Toph lands) Umm, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction. (They cringe as their surroundings continue to crumble and shake)\n\nAang: (Camera pans down to Appa's head) We'll get through, let's go.\n\n",

"Zuko: She's not going to make it.\n\nZuko: Of course she did.\n\n",

"Aang: Wow, camping. It really seems like old times again, doesn't it\n\nZuko: (Cut to Zuko who breaks a biscuit in half) If you really want to feel like old times, I could, uhh... chase you around a while and try to capture you.\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to a close up side view of Katara who looks down sorely) Haha.\n\nSokka: (Cut to Sokka and he raises his cup) To Zuko. Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero.\n\n",

"Toph, Aang, Suki & Sokka: Here, here. (Toph and Aang nudge Zuko with their elbows)\n\nZuko: (smiles warmly) I'm touched. I don't deserve this.\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to Katara who glares at him) Yeah, no kidding. (Cut to an overhead view of the group as she stands up and leaves)\n\nSokka: (raises an eyebrow) What's with her?\n\n",

"Zuko: (stands up)I wish I knew. (He walks off as the others look at him quizzically)\n\nSokka: What's with him?\n\n",











"Suki: (raises her arms and blushes) Opps, wrong tent.\n\nZuko: (Suki walks away) Sorry. Do you need to talk to Sokka too?\n\n",

"Suki:(still blushing) Nope. Not me.\n\nSokka: (turns his head with a rose in his mouth) Well, hellooo. Uh, Zuko. Yes, (sits up) why would I be expecting any one different? So what's on your mind?\n\n",



"Zuko: (interrupts) Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of no where,  but I want you to tell me what happened to your Mother.\n\nSokka: (Cut to a stunned Sokka) What? Why would you want to know that?\n\n",

"Zuko: Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow... she's connected her anger about that to her anger at me.\n\nSokka: It's not a day I like to remember.\n\n",

"Katara: I'm going to find Mum. (She runs past her brother. Sokka runs the other direction)\n\nSokka:(voiceover)Many of the warriors have seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant. A Fire Nation raid.\n\n",







"Sokka: Yeah... Sea Ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them. \n\nZuko: The symbol of The Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka.\n\n",

"Sokka: No problem. (places an arm around Zuko's shoulder) Thanks for stopping by. (pushes the tent opening aside and shoves Zuko out and sighs) Thought he never leave. Suki.\n\nKatara: You look terrible. (She >ignores him and rummages through her bag)\n\n",

"Zuko: (stands up and rubs his eyes) I waited out here all night. (Katara proceeds to comb her hair)\n\nKatara: What do you want?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to a close up of Katara with Zuko behind her) I know who killed your Mother. (she widens her eyes and stops combing) I'm going to help you find him.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Katara: I need to borrow Appa.\n\nAang: (feeding Appa hay) Why? Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with Zuko?\n\n",

"Katara: Yes, it is.\n\nAang: (Cut to Aang who is surprised) Oh. What's going on?\n\n",

"Katara: We're going to find the man who took my Mother from me.\n\nZuko: (off screen) Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it. And I know how to find him.\n\n",

"Aang: Umm... and what exactly do you think this would accomplish?\n\nKatara: (sighs and shakes her head) I knew you wouldn't understand. (She begins to walk away)\n\n",

"Aang: I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge.\n\nKatara: (off screen) Fine! (Cut to an angry and frustrated Katara) Maybe it is. Maybe that's what I need. Maybe that's what he deserves.\n\n",

"Aang: Katara, you sound like Jet.\n\nKatara: (defensively) It's not the same. Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster.\n\n",

"Sokka: Katara, she was my Mother too. But I think Aang might be right.\n\nKatara: Then you didn't love her the way I did.\n\n",

"Sokka: (speechless) Katara...\n\nAang: The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed ratviper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.\n\n",

"Zuko: That's cute. But this isn't air temple pre-school. It's the real World.\n\nKatara: (Camera zooms out to place Katara on screen) Now that I know he's out there, now that I know we could find him, I feel like I have no choice.\n\n",

"Aang: Katara, you do have a choice. Forgiveness.\n\nZuko: That's the same as doing nothing.\n\n",

"Aang: (shakes head) No it's not. It's easy to do nothing. (Camera slowly zooms in) But it's hard to forgive.\n\nKatara: (Cut to Katara who looks on darkly) It's not just hard, it's impossible.\n\n",

"Aang: (Aang & Sokka climb over the rock) So you were just going to take Appa anyway?\n\nKatara: Yes.\n\n",

"Aang: It's okay, because I forgive you. (smiles< hopefully) That give you any ideas?\n\nKatara: (Cut to a side view of the scene. Zuko is also wearing the same outfit as Katara and is packing his bag.) Don't try to stop us.\n\n",

"Aang: I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out and then let it go. Forgive him.\n\nZuko: Okay, we'll be sure to do that guru-goody-goody.\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to Katara looking down at Aang from Appa's head) Thanks for understanding Aang. Yip yip. (Appa takes off. Cut back to an area behind the guys as they look up at the departing bison)\n\nSokka: You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.\n\n",

"Aang: Thanks, Sokka.\n\nSokka: Usually it's annoying but right now, I'm just impressed.\n\n",

"Aang: (narrows his eyes) I appreciate that.\n\nSokka: So... can I borrow Momo for a week?\n\n",

"Aang: Why do you need Momo?\n\nZuko: (off screen) We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower. All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.\n\n",




"Zuko: You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength.\n\nKatara: Now, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. (Cut to a side view of Katara) I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came.\n\n",

"Katara: I'm going to find Mum.\n\nKatara: Mum!\n\n",

"Katara's Mum: (off screen) Just let her go and (Cut to Katara's Mum who pleads) I'll give you the information you want.\n\nFire Nation soldier: (Camera pans up to the soldier) You heard\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to an area behind her Mother's shoulder as Katara looks on, frightened) Mum, I'm scared.\n\nKatara's Mum: (assuringly) Go find your Dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut to a desperate Katara running in the snow) I ran as fast as I could.\n\nKatara: (shouts) Dad! Dad! (Camera pans down to show Hakoda throwing a firebending soldier hard into the snow.) Please, I think Mum's in trouble! There's a man in our house.\n\n",

"Hakoda: Kya!\n\nKatara: But, we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. (voice cracks slightly) And so was she.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to a sorrowful Zuko) Your Mother was a brave woman.\n\nKatara: (Cut to a front shot of Katara as she touches her necklace) I know.\n\n",

"Zuko: There! (Katara's head pops up from the saddle) See those Sea Raven flags? It's The Southern Raiders.\n\nKatara: Let's do this.\n\n",

"Soldier: So there I was and I was like, you know, you could...\n\nZuko: This is it, Katara. Are you ready to face him?\n\n",

"Act III\n\nCaptain: Who are you?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut to Zuko remaining in a stance and Katara looking on vehemently behind him) You don't remember her? You will soon. Trust me.\n\nCaptain: What? What's happening to me?\n\n",

"Zuko: Think back. Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.\n\nCaptain: (Cut to the Captain who lays huddled on the floor) I don't know what you're talking about. Please, I don't know!\n\n",

"Zuko: (Camera zooms out to show Zuko kneeling near the Captain's head) Don't lie! You look her (points back to Katara) in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did.\n\nKatara: (eyes widen in shock) It's not him. He's not the man.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut back to Zuko) What?! What do you mean he's not? He's a leader of The Southern Raiders! (The Captains stirs behind him) He has to be the guy!\n\nZuko: If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?\n\n",

"Captain: (Cut back to the Captain's face pressed up against the glass) You must be looking for Yon Rha. He retired 4 years ago.\n\nOld Lady: Yon Rha, you lazy piece of work, I need something.\n\n",

"Yon Rha: (stops his work and attempts to placate) Yes Mother, what is it?\n\nYon Rha's Mother: The tomato-carrot from your garden are too hard for my gums. I need something soft and juicy.\n\n",

"Yon Rha: (Cut to an area behind his Mother's hand looking at Yon Rha's back as he turns to face his Mum) Would you like something else from the garden? I would be happy to...\n\nYon Rha's Mother: (her fists clenches and she interrupts) Forget\n\n",

"Yon Rha: (Cut back to Yon Rha who looks on quizzically) Hello? (He turns to the stall owner) Did you see someone?\n\nYon Rha: Hello? (Cut to an area above Yon Rha as the camera pans down to show a person hiding away to avoid being spotted) Is someone there?\n\n",

"Katara: That was him. (Cut to Katara's eyes as they shine with hate) That was the monster.\n\nYon Rha: Nobody sneaks up on me (he drops his basket, turns and firebends) without being burned.\n\n",

"Zuko: We weren't behind the bush. (Cut to a side view of the confrontation as Zuko takes a step forward to threaten Yon Rha.)\n\nYon Rha: Whoever you are, take my money. Take whatever you want, I'll cooperate.\n\n",

"Katara: Do you know who I am?\n\nYon Rha: (Cut back to Yon Rha) No, (his eyes widen in fear) I'm not sure.\n\n",

"Katara: Oh you better remember me like your life depends on it! (Yon  Rha places his arm in front of his face) Why don't you take a closer look.\n\nYon Rha: Yes, yes. I remember you now. (Cut back to Katara) You're the little Water Tribe girl.\n\n",

"Kya: (off screen) Just let her go and (Camera zooms out to show Kya kneeling on the floor in front of Yon Rha) I'll give you the information you want.\n\nYon Rha: (Cut to Yon Rha looking down at Katara) You heard your Mother, get out of here!\n\n",

"Katara: (Katara holds her hands together) Mum, I'm scared.\n\nKya: (Cut back to Kya) Go find your Dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.\n\n",

"Yon Rha: (Cut back to the inside of the house) Now, tell me. Who is it? Who's the waterbender?\n\nKya: There are no waterbenders here. (frowns) The Fire Nation took them all away a long time ago.\n\n",


"Yon Rha: (Cut to a close up of Yon Rha who smiles evilly) I'm afraid I'm not taking prisoners today.\n\nKatara: She lied to you. (Cut to a close up of Katara as she closes her eyes sadly) She was protecting the last waterbender.\n\n",

"Yon Rha: (surprised) What? Who?\n\nKatara: (Cut back to Katara who opens her eyes and looks back furiously) ME!\n\n",










"Yon Rha: (Cut to Yon Rha as he pleads) Please spare me.\n\nKatara: (Cut to a visibly angry Katara) But as much as I hate you... (Her eyes start to shimmer with emotion) I just can't do it.\n\n",

"Aang: (off screen) Katara! (Camera pans up to show Aang and Zuko approaching her) Are you okay?\n\nKatara: (Cut to Katara's back) I'm doing fine.\n\n",

"Aang: Zuko told me what you did. Or... what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you.\n\nKatara: I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him but, I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or if it's because I'm strong enough not to.",

"Aang: You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing.\n\nKatara: But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. But I am ready to forgive you, Zuko.\n\n",

"Zuko: (off screen) You were right about what Katara needed.(Cut to Zuko and Aang who smiles) Violence wasn't the answer.\n\nAang: It never is.\n\n",







"Act I\n\nKatara: (Cut to a close up of the 2 girls. Toph is napping.) Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding (looks around the courtyard) from the Fire Lord in his own house?\n\n",

"Zuko: I told you, my Father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. This is the last place anyone would think to look for us.\n\nSokka: You guys are not going to believe this. There's a play about us.\n\n",

"Suki: (Cut to a close up of the couple. Suki has donned a Fire Nation disguise similar to Azula's evening outfit in The Beach) We were just in town and we found this poster.\n\nKatara: What? How is that possible?\n\n",

"Sokka: Listen to this. \"The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.\"",


"Zuko: Ugh. My Mother used to take us to see them. They butchered \"Love Amongst The Dragons\" every year.\n\nKatara: Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?\n\n",










"Sokka: Come on, a day at the theatre? (Unrolls the scroll towards his sister) This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing.\n\nAang: Hey, uh... I wanted to sit (points at Zuko's spot) there. (he clenches his hands together)\n\n",

"Zuko: (lowers his hood) Just sit next to me, what's the big deal?\n\nAang: I was (Katara looks at the commotion and looks back to the stage) just... I wanted to... (sits next to Zuko) Okay.\n\n",

"Toph: (Cut to an undershot of the viewing box as Sokka and Suki sit in the row behind the 4 of them) Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section? My feet can't see a thing from up here.\n\nKatara: Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.\n\n",

"Actress Katara: (sighs) Sokka, my only brother. We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas and yet never do we find anything fulfilling.\n\nActor Sokka: All I want is a full feeling in my stomach, I'm starving!\n\n",

"Actress Katara: Is food the only thing on your mind?\n\nActor Sokka: Well, I'm trying to get it out of my mind and (Cut to a close up of actor Sokka as he points to his mouth) into my mouth. I'm starving.\n\n",

"Sokka: This is pathetic. My (points his thumb to himself) jokes are way funnier than this. (throws out his arm towards the stage)\n\nToph: (Toph laughs and the siblings look at her) I think he's got you pegged.\n\n",




"Toph: Oh man, this writer's a genius.\n\nActress Katara: It appears to be someone frozen in ice. Perhaps for a hundred years.\n\n",

"Actor Sokka: (Cut to a close up of the cut out.)But who? Who is the boy in the iceberg?\n\nActress Katara: Waterbend, hai-ya!\n\n",

"Actress Katara: Who are you, frozen boy?\n\nActress >Aang: (giggles and balances tip toed on one leg) I'm the Avatar, silly. Here to spread (pirouettes on her balancing leg) joy and fun.\n\n",

"Aang: (in disbelief) Wait, is that a woman playing me?\n\nActress Katara: (gasp) An airbender. My heart is so full of hope that it's (drops to her knees) making me (grabs actress Aang's leg and cries) tearbend.\n\n",

"Actor Sokka: My stomach is so empty that it's making me tearbend. (He drops to his knees and grabs actress Aang's other leg and sobs) I need meat. (Cut to a close up of actor Sokka)\n\nActress Aang: But wait. Is that a platter of meaty dumplings?\n\n",







"ActressAang: (giggles uncontrollably) Did I mention (crosses her legs) that I'm an incurable prankster?\n\nAang: (giggles uncontrollably) Did I mention (crosses her legs) that I'm an incurable prankster?\n\n",

"Aang: (irritated) I don't do that. That's not what I'm like! And... I'm not a woman!\n\nToph: (laughs out loud as the rest turn to look at her) Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes.\n\n",

"Actor Uncle: Prince Zuko, you must try this cake.\n\nActor Zuko: I don't have time to stuff my face. (His voice is rougher and deeper than Zuko's. Helowers the telescope and faces the audience) I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor!\n\n",







"Actor Uncle: Well, while you do that, maybe I'll capture another slice.\n\nActor Zuko: You sicken me.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut back to Zuko with Katara looking very amused) They make me\n\nKatara: Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.\n\n",

"Zuko: (looks to Katara and stretches both arms out) How could you say that?\n\nActor Uncle: Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages.\n\n",





"Puppet Momo: Hi, everybody. I love you.\n\nActor Sokka: Does this dress make my butt look fat?\n\n",





"Zuko: Imagine striking through your opponent's heart.\n\nAang: Ugh! I'm trying.\n\n",

"Actor Zuko: Now let me hear you roar like a tiger-dillo!\n\nActor Zuko: That sounded pathetic! (Cut back to Zuko lashing out) I said roar!\n\n",

"Actress Katara: Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice?\n\nActress Aang: Ooo, ooo, (turns around) me, me, me! (he begins to run towards the house)\n\n",






"Actor Toph: Not bad, baldy. But I've been working on my sandbending (stretches and cracks her fingers) You're gonna love this.\n\nActress Aang: Whoa. Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco.\n\n",

"Actor Toph: Try and top that, Sokka.\n\nActor Sokka: Ta-da!\n\n",

"Actress Aang: Is that a blubbering, blob monster?\n\nActor Sokka: No, (stomps the ground defensively) it's Suki. (Cut to Aang with an animated look of shock and surprise on his face as both he and Toph burst into a fit of laughter.)\n\n",

"Actor Toph: Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.\n\nActress Suki:I think it's sweet. (Sokka runs and slides into screen on his knees as he grabs Suki by her shoulders and kisses her on the cheek.)\n\n",







"Toph: And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. \n\nZuko: So... You all knew Aang was going to wait?\n\n",



"Toph: So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?\n\nActor Sokka: Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.\n\n",

"Actor Toph: Sweetness. (smiles)\n\nActor Toph: Muahahahahahaha!\n\nActor Sokka: (shakes his fist) Watch it, Toph!\n\nActor Toph: (Cut back to Toph who is clearly enjoying herself) I am not Toph, I am \"Melon Lord\"! Muahahahahaha!\n\n",




"Aang: (shakes head) I can't.\n\nSokka: What's wrong with you? (points accusingly at Aang) If this was the real deal, (points at Aang again) you'd be shot full of lightning (he makes a beheading gesture against his neck) right now.\n\n",

"Aang: I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.\n\nSokka: (off screen) There. (Aang opens his eyes in shock) That's how it's done.\n\n",

"Katara: I have a surprise for everyone!\n\nToph: (Cut to Toph holding her chopsticks in her bowl of rice) I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru!\n\n",

"Katara: Er, no. (All 4 of them suddenly start to shove rice into their mouths) I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this.  Look at baby Zuko! Isn't he cute?\n\nKatara: Oh lighten up, I was just teasing.\n\n",

"Zuko: (opens his eyes) That's not me. It's my Father. (Camera zooms out to show them again as Katara rapidly rolls the scroll)\n\nSuki:(points at the scroll and looks at Zuko) But he looked so sweet and innocent.\n\n",

"Zuko: Well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster. And the worst Father in the history of Fathers.\n\nAang: But he is still a human being. (Everyone looks at him as the camera pans to Aang)\n\n",

"Zuko: You're going to defend him?\n\nAang: No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai (stands up and faces the group) is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without him. There's gotta be another way.\n\n",

"Zuko: (off screen) Like what?\n\nAang: (shrugs)I don't know. Maybe (raises both arms as if he was holding a bowl) we can make some big pots of glue and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.\n\n",

"Zuko: (sarcastically) Yeah. Then you can show him his baby pictures and all those happy memories (everyone starts to laugh and snicker) will make him good again.\n\nAang: (naively) Do you really think that would work?\n\n",

"Zuko:(seriously and sternly) No!\n\nAang: (drops his head and sighs) This goes against (paces up and down, looking at his hands) everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like...\n\n",

"Sokka: Sure, you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the Universe will forgive you.\n\nAang: This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understands the position I'm in!\n\n",



"Katara: Aang, don't walk away from this. (She begins to walk towards him as a hand touches her shoulder to stop her from doing so.)\n\nZuko: Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.\n\n",

"Aang: Hey, Momo. (pats Momo's head) I don't suppose you know what I should do. (Cut to Momo who makes a sound) I didn't think so.\n\nAct III\n\n",

















"Sokka: Okay, that's everything.\n\nToph: (Cut to Toph's back view. She is sitting on some stone steps) No, it's not. (Everyone turns to face her) Where's Aang?\n\n",

"Zuko: (Cut back to inside the house. Everyone runs up the steps to the corridor and looks around.) Aang? Aang!\n\nToph: Come on lazy bones, let's go.\n\n",

"Sokka: (his gloved hand grabs the staff) He left his staff. That's so strange.\n\nZuko: Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach.\n\n",

"Sokka: Look! There's his footprints. (Camera pans up to the path of footprints leading to the sea.) The trail ends here.\n\nSuki:So... He went for a midnight swim and never came back?\n\n",

"Katara: Maybe he was captured.\n\nSokka: I don't think so. There's no sign of a struggle.\n\n",

"Toph: (bends down) I bet he ran away again.\n\nSokka: Ah-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.\n\n",

"Toph: Then what doyouthink happened to him oh sleuthy one?\n\nSokka: It's pretty obvious. (stands up and throws his hands to the side) Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.\n\n",

"Zuko: But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?\n\nSokka: (slumps) Oh yeah, forgot about that.\n\n",

"Katara: Then he's gotta be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.\n\nToph: (grabs Zuko's arm swiftly and he blushes) I'm going with Zuko! What? Everyone else went on a life changing fieldtrip with Zuko. Now it's my turn.\n\n",

"Actress Aang: (The tattooed head turns around) Avatar State, yip yip! (Actor Toph lifts her up in the air as she poses in a flying position as the crowd cheers wildly.\n\nToph: And then when I was nine, I ran away again.\n\n",

"Zuko: Uh-huh.\n\nToph: I know I shouldn't complain,  my parents gave me everything that I ever asked for. But they never gave me the one thing that I really wanted. Their love. You know what I mean?\n\n",

"Zuko: Look, I know you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang. \n\nToph: (Cut back to Toph who looks disappointed) This is the worst fieldtrip ever.\n\n",

"Sokka: Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang either. (Cut back to the steps as Sokka jumps and lands in front of them)\n\nZuko: No. It's like he just... disappeared.\n\n",

"Toph: (sits up) Hey, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo's missing too?\n\nSokka: (turns around in horror) Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time. Appa ate Momo! Momo,  I'm coming for ya, buddy\n\n",

"Katara: (Cut back to Katara who staring calmly at her brother) Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.\n\nSokka: (Cut to outside Appa's mouth as he turns around and looks at his sister) That's just what Appa wants you to think.\n\n",

"Zuko: (off screen) Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. (Cut back to Zuko who is not looking very pleased) We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away.\n\nKatara:  What should we do Zuko?\n\n",

"Zuko: (stands up) I don't know. (Cut to the rest who continue to stare at him) Why are you all looking at me? (Cut back to Zuko who looks around)\n\nKatara: (Cut back to the rest) Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.\n\n",

"Sokka: Zuko, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.\n\nZuko: Just trust me.",

"\n\nAzula: Come on slowpokes, faster!\n\n",

"Azula: Sorry I'm late, Father. Good palanquin bearers (Her eyes look to the side< menancingly) are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure? \n\nFire Lord Ozai: (off screen) There has been a change of plans, Azula.\n\n",

"Azula: (She turns her head back and her eyes widen in shock) What?\n\nFire Lord Ozai: (Cut to Ozai's back) I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Sealone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation.\n\n",

"Azula: (whines and begins to behave like a spoilt child) But I thought we were going to do this together.\n\nFire Lord Ozai: (Cut back to Ozai's back again) My decision isfinal.\n\n",

"Azula: (Cut back to Azula who looks very unhappy) You... (Stands up and talks back to her Father) you can't treat me like this. You can't treat me like Zuko! \n\nFire Lord Ozai: Azula, silence yourself. \n\n",

"Azula: But it was my idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!\n\nFire Lord Ozai: Azula! Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland, it's a very important job that I can only entrust to you.\n\n",

"Azula: (looks up in disbelief) Really?\n\nFire Lord Ozai: And for your loyalty,(turns to face his daughter) I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord.\n\n",

"Fire Lord Ozai: Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the World will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the World. From this moment on, I will be known as... the \"Phoenix King\"",

"Katara: (observing warily) And the reason you brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?\n\nZuko: June.\n\n",

"Sokka: (off screen) Oh yeah (Cut to a close up of June's eye) that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.\n\nSuki:(off screen) Mole? Her skin is flawless.\n\n",



"Zuko: Yup, back in the good old days. (Zuko walks off screen. Cut to a wide shot of the table as the group walks towards June.)\n\nJune: Oh great, (refilling her cup) it's Prince Pouty. Where's your creepy grandpa?\n\n",

"Zuko: He's my Uncle, and he's not here.\n\nJune: (looking at Zuko and Katara and smirking) I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.\n\n",

"Katara: I'm not his girlfriend!\n\nZuko: She's not my girlfriend!\n\n",

"June: Okay, okay, (puts a hand out) sheesh. I was only teasing. So what you want?\n\nZuko: I need your help finding the Avatar.\n\n",

"June: Hmph. Doesn't sound too fun. (She takes another drink from her cup while Zuko gets riled up)\n\nZuko: (He steps closer to June in a slight outburst) Does the end of the World (June pauses and stares at Zuko) sound like more fun?\n\n",

"June: Nyla... Who's my little snuffly wuffle. Whoa! Careful there. Okay, whose got something with the Avatar's scent on it. (Cut to Katara reaching into Appa's saddle)\n\nKatara: I have Aang's staff.\n\n",

"Zuko: (Crossing his arms as Katara and Toph look on puzzled behind him) Well, what does that mean?\n\nJune: It means your friend's gone.\n\n",

"Toph: We know he's gone, that's why we're trying to find him.\n\nJune: (Cut to the back of June's head as she stands up)No, I mean he's gonegone. (She turns back to the group suddenly) He doesn't exist.\n\n",




"June: Nope, we could find him if he were dead. Ah, it's a real head scratcher. See ya. (Cut to a side view of the scene of the group looking at June mount Nyla)\n\nToph: Helpful, real helpful.\n\n",

"Zuko: Wait, I have another idea. There's only one other person in this World who can help us face the Fire Lord. I'll be right back with a smell sample.\n\nSokka: You saved your Uncle's sweaty sandal?\n\n",

"Toph: I think it's kind of sweet. \n\nJune: Let's do this.\n\nZuko: Hey, wait up!\n\nZuko: We're going to Ba Sing Se?\n\n",










"June: Your Uncle's somewhere beyond the wall. Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. Good luck.\n\nZuko: It's been a long day. Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.\n\n",




"Aang: (looking around) So where am I, Roku? What is this place?\n\nAvatar Roku: (Cut to a puzzled Roku looking at the trees) I... don't know, Aang. But I see that you are lost in more ways than one right now.\n\n",

"Aang: I am. (He puts on a serious face) I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.\n\nBumi: Well, look who's (throws his arms out from under his robe) here.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nAang: Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that.\n\n",






"Katara: Not just any old people. These are great masters and friends of ours. Pakku.\n\nPakku: It is respectful to bow to an old master but how about a hug (opens his arms) for your new grandfather?\n\n",

"Katara: That's so exciting. You and Gran Gran must be so happy to have found each other again.\n\nPakku: I made her a new betrothal necklace and everything. \n\n",

"Sokka: Welcome to the family Great Gramp.\n\nPakku: You can still just call me (He pushes Sokka off him) Pakku.\n\n",

"Sokka: (Cut to Sokka who smiles goofily) How about Grand Pakku?\n\nPakku: (Cut to a serious Pakku) No. (Camera pans out to show a disappointed Sokka)\n\n",



"Sokka: Master Piandao.\n\nPiandao: (Bowing in return) Hello, Sokka.\n\n",

"Suki: So wait, how do you all know each other?\n\nBumi: (Cut to a side view of the 4 masters) All old people know (Piandao looks towards Bumi and smiles) each other don't you know that? (Bumi  snorts and laughs)\n\n",

"Piandao: We're all part of the same ancient secret society. A group that transcends the divisions of the 4 nations.\n\nZuko: (Cut to a smiling Zuko) The Order of the White Lotus.\n\n",

"Bumi: That's the one. (Bumi comically exits the screen)\n\nJeong Jeong: The White Lotus has always been about philosophy, and beauty and truth. (Cut to an overhead shot of the scene) About a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important.\n\n",

"Pakku: (Cut to an area behind Zuko's shoulder looking at Pakku and Katara) It came from a Grand Lotus, your Uncle, (Cut to a close up of a smiling Zuko) Iroh of the Fire Nation. \n\nToph: Well that's who we're looking for.\n\n",

"Piandao: (Cut back to a frontal shot of Jeong Jeong and Piandao again) Then we'll take you to him.\n\nBumi: Wait, someone's missing from your group. Someone very important. Where's Momo?\n\n",




"Sokka: He's gone. And so is Aang. \n\nBumi: Oh well, so long as they have each other I'm sure we have nothing to worry about. Let's go.\n\n",




"Aang: Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom.\n\nAvatar Kyoshi: In my day, Chin the Conqueror threatened to throw the World out of balance. I stopped him and the World entered a great era of peace.\n\n",








"Aang: I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.\n\nSokka: So Bumi, how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?\n\n",

"Bumi: Escape? I didn't escape, everybody else escaped. There I was, back in Omashu, waiting for just the right moment. I didn't know what or when but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.\n\n",




"Bumi: Taking back my city. You've got no (His moves one arm across his body) fire power and it's payback time.\n\nSuki: Wow, you took back your whole city all by yourself.\n\n",

"Bumi: So what about you guys? Did you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse? (Cut to Sokka and Zuko who look at each other before Zuko turns his head away)\n\nZuko: Nah.\n\n",

"Sokka: No, not really.\n\nAang: I need to look deep inside myself.\n\n",







"Zuko: Where... where is he?\n\nPiandao: Your Uncle's in (he points out) there, (Cut to Piandao's point of view as he points to a big sheltered tent at the end of campsite) Prince Zuko.\n\n",

"Katara: Are you okay?\n\nZuko: No, I'm not okay. My Uncle hates me, I know it. He loved me and supported me in every way he could and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?\n\n",







"Katara:  Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?\n\nZuko: More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life.\n\n",

"Katara: (raises her shoulders) Then he'll forgive you. (Zuko looks at her) He will.\n\nZuko: Uncle.\n\n",






"Aang: (He looks at Momo) I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. (He looks up towards the sky and Momo ears droop) I have to kill the Fire Lord.\n\nAct III\n\n",

"Zuko: Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me. But I want you to know, I'm so so sorry, Uncle. I'm so sorry and ashamed of what I did. I don't know how I can ever make it up to you but I'll... (Iroh hugs him)",

"Iroh: I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you lost your way.\n\nZuko: I did lose my way.\n\nIroh: But you found it again. And you did it by yourself. And I am so happy you found your way here.",



















"Aang: Wait, is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger?\n\nAang: They're not getting larger, they're getting closer. The whole island is moving!\n\n",

"Aang: (facing the lemur) It's amazing, Momo! (He raises his arms out of the water and opens them to the sides) The biggest animal in the World! (pointing forward) I've got to swim around and find its face.\n\n",



"Toph:You mean the Fire Lord.\n\nZuko: That's what I just said. (Toph resumes eating)\n\n",

"Iroh: Hmm...\n\nZuko: We need you to come with us.\n\nIroh: No, Zuko. It won't turn out well. \n\nZuko: You can beat him and we'll be there to help.\n\n",



"Iroh: No. Someone new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and unquestionable honour. It has to be you, Prince Zuko.\n\nZuko: Unquestionable honour? But I've made so many mistakes.\n\n",





"Iroh: (off screen) Yes, you have. You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed your own path, you restored your own honour. And only you can restore the honour of the Fire Nation.\n\nZuko: I'll try, Uncle.\n\n",



"Zuko: (confidently) I can handle Azula.\n\nIroh: (off screen) Not alone. (Zuko appears startled) You'll need help.\n\n",

"Zuko: You're right. (He looks up) Katara, (Cut to an area behind Zuko looking at Katara as she raises her head up) how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?\n\nKatara: (smiles) It would be my pleasure.\n\n",

"Sokka: (off screen) What (Zuko and Katara turn towards Sokka) about us? (Cut to a sideview of Toph with Sokka in the background) What's (he raises his arms out curiously) our destiny today?\n\nIroh: What do you think it is?\n\n",

"Sokka: I think that... even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet. \n\nToph: And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us.\n\n",






"Zuko: So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?\n\nIroh: After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop and I'm going to play Pai Sho everyday.\n\n",

"Katara: (off screen) Goodbye, General Iroh.\n\nIroh: Goodbye, everyone. (Cut to a frontal shot of Iroh looking up at his nephew) Today, (he closes his eyes and lowers his head) destiny is our friend. I know it.\n\n",

"Aang: A lion turtle. Maybe you can help me. Everyone, even my own past lives are expecting me to end someone's life. But I don't know if I can do it.",

"Lion Turtle: The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can touch the poison of hatred without being harmed. Since beginningless time, darkness thrives in the void, but always yields to purifying light.\n\n",

"Lion Turtle: Wait for it, it will come.",

"Ozai: It's time for this World to end in fire and for a new World to be born from the ashes.\n\n",






"Act I\n\nKatara: Zuko, don't worry, we can take Azula.\n\nZuko: I'm not worried about her, I'm worried about Aang. What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my Father? What if he loses?\n\nKatara: Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back. He has to.\n\n",

"Azula:(sternly)What am I holding?\n\nServant Girl:(quietly)A cherry pit, Princess.\n\n",

"Azula: Correct. And what day is this?\n\nServant Girl: It is the day of your coronation.\n\n",








"Azula: Yes, it is. So please, tell me why on the most important day of my life you decided to leave a pit in my cherry?\n\nServant Girl: It wasn't a decision. It was just a small mistake.\n\n",

"Azula: Small? Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?\n\nServant Girl: I supposed you could have... choked?\n\n",

"Azula: Yes. Then you will understand the severity of your crime.\n\nServant Girl:(bowing her head to the floor)I understand, Princess. Please, forgive me.\n\n",


"Toph: Too bad the Fire Lord is about to use it to destroy the World.\n\nSokka: We're too late! The fleet's already taking off!\n\n",

"Toph: Then we're taking off too. Where's the closest airship?\n\nSokka: It's right...\n\n",

"Toph: Ugh.\n\nDai Li Agent: You sent for us, Princess? Is everything alright?\n\n",

"Azula:(irritated)Actually, everything's not alright. Do you know how long it took you to get here?\n\nDai Li Agent: A... few minutes I guess?\n\n",

"Azula: Five, to be precise. In which time an assassin could have snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way.\n\nDai Li Agent: My apologies, Princess.\n\n",

"Azula: Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? With tardiness and disloyalty?\n\nDai Li Agent: The Dai Li would never betray you.\n\n",

"Azula: And I'm sure that's just what you told Long Feng before you turned against him and joined me. You're all banished!(the camera quickly zooms out from the Dai Li agents as the look up, shocked)\n\nDai Li Agent: But...\n\n",

"Azula: (offscreen) Goodbye.\n\nAzula: Please send in the next group on your way out.\n\n",

"Sokka: Shh.\n\nToph: That's how it's done.\n\n",

"Sokka: Good work, Toph. Time to take control of the ship. Take the wheel.\n\nToph:(sarcastically)That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship.\n\n",

"Sokka: I was talking to Suki.\n\nToph: That would make a lot more sense.\n\n",

"Suki:(taking the wheel)What are we going to do about the rest of the crew?\n\nSokka: Take us down closer to the water. I've got an idea.\n\n",


"Engineer: Oh hi, I work down in the engine room. It's probably why we've never met before. Big airship, you know?\n\nElite Firebender #1: Huh.\n\n",

"Engineer: Yep.\n\nElite Firebender #1: So, do you know whose birthday it is?\n\n",

"Elite Firebender #2:(approaching the firebender and engineer from behind)I can't believe the Captain remembered my birthday! He really does care.\n\nEngineer: Happy Birthday.\n\n",

"Sokka: Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.\n\nAct II\n\n",

"Li: Azula, we heard what happened. Why have you banished all your servants?\n\nLo: All your Dai Li agents?\n\n",

"Li: And the Imperial firebenders?\n\nAzula: None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.\n\n",

"Li & Lo: Azula, we are concerned for you and your well being.\n\nAzula:My Father asked you to come here and talk to me, didn't he He thinks I can't handle the responsibility of being Fire Lord. But I will be the greatest leader in Fire Nation history.\n\n",

"Lo: I'm sure you will. But considering everything that has happened today...\n\nLi: Perhaps it's best you postponed your coronation.\n\n",

"Azula:(angrily)What?! Which one of you just said that?\n\nAzula: What a shame. There's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai.\n\n",

"Lo: But...\n\nLi & Lo: We're not firebenders.\n\n",

"Azula: Alright, fine.(Pointing to Li)Lo, you're banished.(Pointing to Lo)Li, you can stay.(walks off screen)\n\nLi: But I'm Li. So who's banished?\n\n",

"Bumi: Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.\n\nPakku: Here to set you free.\n\n",

"Iroh: Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.\n\nAzula: Alright hair, it's time to face your doom.\n\n",

"Ursa: (off screen) What a shame, you always had such beautiful hair.\n\nAzula: What areyoudoing here?\n\n",

"Ursa: I didn't want to miss my own daughter's coronation.\n\nAzula: Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You think I'm a monster.\n\n",

"Ursa: I think you're confused. All your life you used fear to control people. Like your friends Mai and Ty Lee.\n\nAzula: But what choice do I have?! Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me.\n\n",

"Ursa: No. Iloveyou, Azula. I do.\n\nSokka: We're not going to catch up to him in time.\n\n",

"Suki:(sadly)No...\n\nAang: Momo, time for you to go.\n\n",

"Suki: What just happened?\n\nSokka:(excited)It's Aang! He's back!\n\n",

"Act III\n\nOzai:(off screen)After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you, now the Universe delivers you to me as an act of providence.\n\n",

"Aang: Please listen to me. We don't have to fight. You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing.\n\nOzai: You are right. I do have the power. I have all the power in the World!\n\n",

"Sokka: Go, Aang! Airbending slice!(swings his hand down)\n\nSuki: Shouldn't we be helping him?\n\n",

"Sokka: The Fire Lord is Aang's fight. We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.\n\nToph: And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang? I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal.\n\n",

"Sokka:(smiles as he comes up with an idea and turns around)Airship slice!\n\nToph: Whoa. That's a lot of fire, isn't it?\n\n",

"Sokka: It's going to be a rough ride. We need to get to the top of this thing, fast.\n\nSuki: Then what?\n\n",

"Sokka: Watch each other's backs and if we make it that far, I'll let you know.\n\nSokka: Suki!\n\n",

"Suki: I'm okay! Just finish the mission!\n\nSokka: No...\n\n",

"Toph: Sokka, I think we've gotta...\n\nSokka & Toph: Jump!\n\n",

"Fire Sage: By decree of Phoenix King Ozai, I now crown you Fire Lord...\n\nAzula: What are you waiting for? Do it!\n\n",

"Zuko: Sorry, but you're not going to become Fire Lord today.(jumps off Appa)I am.\n\nAzula:(laughs)You're hilarious.\n\n",

"Katara:(standing beside Zuko)And you're going down.\n\nAzula: Wait. You want to be Fire Lord Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!\n\n",

"Zuko: You're on.\n\nKatara: What are you doing? She's playing you. She knows she can't take us both so she is trying to separate us.\n\n",

"Zuko: I know. But I can take her this time.\n\nKatara: But even you admitted to your Uncle that you would need help facing Azula.\n\n",

"Zuko: There's something off about her, I can't explain it but she's slipping. And this way, no one else has to get hurt.\n\nAzula: I'm sorry it has to end this way,brother.\n\n",

"Zuko:(in his stance)No, you're not.\n\nZuko: No lightning, today? What's the matter? Afraid I'll re-direct it?\n\n",

"Azula: Oh, I'LLSHOWYOU LIGHTNING!\n\nZuko:(slow motion)No!\n\n",

"Katara: Zuko!\n\nOzai: You're weak! Just like the rest of your people. They did not deserve to exist in this world, inmyworld. Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!\n\n",



"Act I\n\nOzai: (off screen) Come on out (Aang cringes as the rock ball shakes and trembles.) Avatar, you can't (Cut to Ozai who is sending a strong, continuous stream of fire towards the rockball)hide in there forever!\n\n",

"Sokka: Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in the turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others.\n\nToph: Got it.\n\n",

"Sokka: (surprised and joyful) Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?\n\nToph: You could stand to mention it more.\n\n",

"Sokka: (grimaces) My leg! (He looks through the U-shaped opening) Hang on Toph!\n\nToph: Aye aye, Captain.\n\n",

"Sokka: Bye Space Sword.\n\nSokka:I don't think Boomerang is coming back, Toph. (Toph tears up) It looks like this is the end.\n\n",

"Toph: How did that happen? Did Boomerang come back?\n\nSokka: (looking up and smiling) No, (Cut to show smiling Suki hanging from a harness near the rudder of the airship) Suki did.\n\n",

"Ozai: Come on out little boy, (Cut to a close up side shot of Ozai as he bends forward to the pile) you're about to be...\n\nAzula: I'd really rather our family physician look after little Zuzu if you don't mind!\n\n",

"Azula: (off screen) Zuzu, (Cut to an area behind Katara looking at Zuko) you don't look so good!\n\nAzula: There you (Cut to a frontal shot of haggard and angry Azula) are, filthy peasant!\n\n",

"Zuko:(whispering weakly) Thank you, Katara.\n\nKatara: (Cut to Katara who tears up) I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.\n\n",

"Act II\n\nAang: (his voice is mixed together with the previous Avatars) Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now (Ozai looks on frightened) you shall pay the ultimate price.\n\n",

"Aang: (Camera pans across Aang's face to show Ozai kneeling behind him) No... I'm not going to end it like this.\n\nOzai: Even with all the power in the World, (Cut to Ozai who looks on slyly) you are still weak.\n\n",

"Lion Turtle:In the era before the Avatar,we bend not the elements, (Cut to a sideview shot of the scene as the lion turtle raises its claw out of the water) but the energy within ourselves.\n\n,we bend not the elements,but the energy within ourselves.\n\n",

"Lion Turtle: (voice over) To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable, or you will be corrupted and destroyed.\n\nOzai: What...what did you do to me?\n\n",

"Aang: I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.\n\nAct III\n\n",







"Ozai: I'm still alive.\n\nAang: I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.\n\n",

"Toph: (Sokka and Toph widen their eyes with surprise) Wow, who taught you that?\n\nAang: A giant Lion Turtle.\n\n",

"Toph:(She crosses her arms and Sokka walks off screen) You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.\n\nSokka: (mocking) Well, look at you buster. Now that your firebending is gone, I guess we should call you the \"Loser Lord\".\n\n",

"Ozai: (pulls himself up with the help from the rock behind him) I am the Phoenix King!\n\nToph: Oh sorry, didn't mean to offend you \"Phoenix King of (punches her fist into her palm) Getting His Butt Whupped.\"\n\n",

"Suki: (Cut to a close up of a drooling Ozai with Suki, Sokka and Toph still visible in the background) Yeah, or how about \"King of the Guys Who... Don't Win\"\n\nToph: Leave the nicknames to us (points to herself) honey.\n\n",

"Mai:(off screen) You need some help with that?\n\nZuko: (Cut to a delighted Zuko) Mai! (Walks off screen) You're ok. (Cut to an area behind Mai's back as Zuko opens his arms out in a hug) They let you out of prison?\n\n",

"Mai: My uncle (Zuko puts his arms through the sleeve) pulled some strings, (she proceeds to fasten his robe) and it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend.\n\nZuko: So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?\n\n",

"Mai: (she blushes) I think it means... (Cut to a close up of the couple) I actually (places a hand on Zuko's cheek) kind of like you.  But don't ever break up with me again.\n\nSokka:Dad!\n\n",

"Katara: Dad!\n\nHakoda: I heard what you two did. (Cut to a close up Hakoda) I am the proudest father in the world. (Sokka smiles) And your mother (Camera pans to the right as Hakoda looks at his daughter) would be proud too.\n\n",

"Sokka: (off screen) There's my favorite warriors. I have to admit, (Camera zooms out to reveal 2 more warriors standing behind Suki) I kind of missed the face paint. How does it feel to be back in uniform again \n\nTy Lee: It feels great!\n\n",

"Sokka: (He stands in front of Suki protectively while pointing his crutch towards Ty Lee) Careful Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.\n\nSuki: It's ok. (Sokka relaxes) She's one of us now. \n\n",

"Ty Lee: Yeah, the girls and I (Cut to a close up of Ty Lee) really bonded in prison. (She walks off screen and the camera follows her) And after a few Chi blocking lessons, they said I could join their group. We're going to be best friends forever.",

"Zuko: I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down, and now...\n\nAang: And now we're friends.\n\nZuko: Yeah...we are friends. (Camera pans out to an area directly in front of the curtain looking at the 2 boys.)\n\n",




"Aang: I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice. The World's so different now.\n\nZuko: And it's gonna be even more different, when we build it together.\n\n",

"Zuko: Please, the real hero is the Avatar.\n\nZuko: Today, this war is finally over. I promised my Uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation, and I will. The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided.",









"Ozai: I should count myself lucky. The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lonely prison cell.\n\n",

"Zuko:You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life. Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. It put me on the right path; perhaps your time in here can do the same for you.\n\nOzai:  Why are you really here?\n\n",

"Zuko: (off screen) Because you are gong to tell me something. Where is my mother?",

"\n\nSokka: Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together. (He sticks his tongue out comically as his sister walks into screen)\n\n",

"Katara: That's very thoughtful of you Sokka. Wait! Why did you give me Momo's ears?\n\nSokka: (off screen) Those are your hair loopies.\n\n",

"Zuko: At least you don't look like a boarcupine. My hair's not that spiky!\n\nMai: (off screen) I look like a man.\n\n",

"Suki: And why did you paint me firebending?\n\nSokka: I thought it looked more exciting that way.\n\n",

"Sokka:Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?\n\nIroh: Hey, my belly's not that big anymore, (Aang pats Appa's snout) I've really trimmed down.\n\n",
